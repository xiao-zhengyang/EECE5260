Title: An engineered <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> with rapid growth and efficient lipid utilization.
Abstract: <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, a safe yeast, efficiently metabolizes lipids for the production of food additives and agricultural products. Boosting its growth and lipid utilization capabilities is crucial to enhancing the overall efficiency <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. Herein, an integrated strategy was implemented to enhance lipid uptake, accumulation and metabolism and systematically promote the growth and lipid utilization of the commonly used <i>Y. lipolytica</i> Po1f strain. The engineered strain had a specific growth rate of 0.32 h<sup>-1</sup> and a lipid content of 67.66 % (g/g DCW), which were 54 % and 26 % greater than those of the original strain. <i>β</i>-Carotene was used to verify the production of lipophilic natural compounds, and the highest yield was obtained 48 h earlier using the engineered strain compared to the original strain when consuming same carbon source. These findings show promise in using engineered <i>Y. lipolytica</i> for rapid growth and improved lipid utilization to boost efficiency of lipophilic product production.

Title: Secretory and metabolic engineering of squalene in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: This short communication systematically explored ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and developed a carrier protein-mediated metabolite trafficking system to engineer Yarrowia lipolytica for secretion of squalene. Specially, the squalene biosynthesis pathway was overexpressed to improve squalene production. Subsequently, a series of ABC transporters and oxysterol-binding proteins (OSH) were screened, with the combination of SNQ2 and OSH3 showing the most significant improvement in squalene secretion. Additionally, we designed a carrier protein-mediated metabolite trafficking system by fusing the binding domain of OSH3 with a secretion signal peptide. This approach, combined with the optimization of signal peptides, increased squalene secretion to 144.67 mg/L, which represented a 17-fold improvement over the initial strain. This system also demonstrated versatility by facilitating the extracellular export of β-carotene. In fed-batch cultivation, the engineered strain secreted 3.43 g/L of squalene extracellularly, accounting for 27.2 % of the total production. It represented the highest secretion level reported to date. This study establishes an efficient secretion platform for the transport of membrane-impermeable squalene in Y. lipolytica, providing valuable insights and strategies for the microbial production of terpenoids.

Title: Substrate-dependent lipid and β-carotene production in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica: a comparative study.
Abstract: This study evaluates the influence of various substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetic acid) on the growth and metabolite production of Yarrowia lipolytica in fed-batch bioreactors. The primary aim is to understand how substrate choice impacts lipid and β-carotene production, critical for bioenergy and bioproducts. The study demonstrates that the choice of substrate significantly influences biomass yield, lipid content, and β-carotene levels. Among the substrates tested, glycerol yielded the highest biomass concentration of 5.31 g/L. Glucose led to the highest lipid content, with a yield of 35.8% (g lipids/g biomass), while acetic acid resulted in the highest lipid concentration, reaching 1.42 g/L. In terms of β-carotene production, glucose showed the highest content per cell at 63.3 mg/g, whereas glycerol led to the highest overall concentration of 202 mg/L. These findings highlight Y. lipolytica's versatility and potential as a flexible platform to produce lipids and β-carotene, which are essential for developing sustainable biofuels and bioproducts. The study underscores the significant variations in metabolite production based on substrate choice, emphasizing on the importance of tailored strategies to optimize industrial applications. Further research may explore optimizing fermentation conditions to enhance production yields, making this yeast a viable option for various biotechnological applications.

Title: Engineering Yarrowia lipolytica for the production of β-carotene by carbon and redox rebalancing.
Abstract: β-Carotene is a natural product that has garnered significant commercial interest. Considerable efforts have been made to meet such demand through the metabolic engineering of microorganisms, yet there is still potential for improvement. In this study, engineering approaches including carbon and redox rebalancing were used to maximize β-carotene production in Yarrowia lipolytica. The initial production level was increased by iterative overexpression of pathway genes with lycopene inhibition removal. For further improvement, two approaches that redirect the central carbon pathway were evaluated to increase NADPH regeneration and reduce ATP expenditure. Pushing flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and introducing NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were found to be more effective than the phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase (PK-PTA) pathway. Furthermore, flux to the lipid biosynthesis pathway was moderately increased to better accommodate the increased β-carotene pool, resulting in the production level of 809.2 mg/L. The Y. lipolytica-based β-carotene production chassis was successfully developed through iterative overexpression of multiple pathways, central carbon pathway engineering and lipid pathway flux adjustment. The approach presented here provides insights into future endeavors to improve microbial terpenoid production capability.

Title: Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for the production and secretion of the saffron ingredient crocetin.
Abstract: Crocetin is a multifunctional apocarotenoid natural product derived from saffron, holding significant promises for protection against various diseases and other nutritional applications. Historically, crocetin has been extracted from saffron stigmas, but this method is hindered by the limited availability of high-quality raw materials and complex extraction processes. To overcome these challenges, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology can be applied to the sustainable production of crocetin. We constructed a Yarrowia lipolytica strain using hybrid promoters and copy number adjustment, which was able to produce 2.66 g/L of β-carotene, the precursor of crocetin. Next, the crocetin biosynthetic pathway was introduced, and we observed both the production and secretion of crocetin. Subsequently, the metabolite profiles under varied temperatures were studied and we found that low temperature was favorable for crocetin biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica. Therefore, a two-step temperature-shift fermentation strategy was adopted to optimize yeast growth and biosynthetic enzyme activity, bringing a 2.3-fold increase in crocetin titer. Lastly, fermentation media was fine-tuned for an optimal crocetin output of 30.17 mg/L, bringing a 51% higher titer compared with the previous highest report in shake flasks. Concomitantly, we also generated Y. lipolytica strains capable of achieving substantial zeaxanthin production, yielding 1575.09 mg/L, doubling the previous highest reported titer. Through metabolic engineering and fermentation optimization, we demonstrated the first de novo biosynthesis of crocetin in the industrial yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. In addition, we achieved a higher crocetin titer in flasks than all our known reports. This work not only represents a high production of crocetin, but also entails a significant simultaneous zeaxanthin production, setting the stage for sustainable and cost-effective production of these valuable compounds.

Title: Designing synthetic microbial communities with the capacity to upcycle fermentation byproducts to increase production yields.
Abstract: Microbial cell factories, which convert feedstocks into a product of value, have the potential to help transition toward a bio-based economy with more sustainable ways to produce food, fuels, chemicals, and materials. One common challenge found in most bioconversions is the co-production, together with the product of interest, of undesirable byproducts or overflow metabolites. Here, we designed a strategy based on synthetic microbial communities to address this issue and increase overall production yields. To achieve our goal, we created a Yarrowia lipolytica co-culture comprising a wild-type (WT) strain that consumes glucose to make biomass and citric acid (CA), and an 'upcycler' strain, which consumes the CA produced by the WT strain. The co-culture produced up to two times more β-carotene compared with the WT monoculture using either minimal medium or hydrolysate. The proposed strategy has the potential to be applied to other bioprocesses and organisms.

Title: Efficient Production of the Colorless Carotenoid Phytoene in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> through Metabolic Engineering.
Abstract: Phytoene, a colorless carotenoid with unique ultraviolet (UV)-B absorption properties, offers potential for applications in functional food, cosmetics, and therapeutics. However, their low natural yield poses a challenge for large-scale production. This study aims to enhance phytoene production in the oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> by introducing a heterologous phytoene synthase gene combined with metabolic engineering approaches. We enhanced phytoene synthesis by overexpressing key genes in the mevalonate pathway and compartmentalizing the biosynthetic pathway within peroxisomes. Moreover, we inhibited the glyoxylate cycle to increase the accumulation of peroxisomal acetyl-CoA available for phytoene production. Our engineered strains demonstrated a significant increase in phytoene production, reaching up to 1.34 g/L titer and 58.74 mg/gDCW yield in the flask-scale fed-batch culture, which are the highest levels reported to date. These results underscore the potential of <i>Y. lipolytica</i> as a robust platform for producing phytoenes and other terpenoids on an industrial scale, offering valuable insights for future efforts in metabolic engineering.

Title: Screening of novel β-carotene hydroxylases for the production of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin and the impact of enzyme localization and crowding on their production in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Zeaxanthin, a vital dietary carotenoid, is naturally synthesized by plants, microalgae, and certain microorganisms. Large-scale zeaxanthin production can be achieved through plant extraction, chemical synthesis, or microbial fermentation. The environmental and health implications of the first two methods have made microbial fermentation an appealing alternative for natural zeaxanthin production despite the challenges in scaling up the bioprocess. An intermediate between β-carotene and zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, is found only in specific fruits and vegetables and has several important functions for human health. The low concentration of β-cryptoxanthin in these sources results in low extraction yields, making biotechnological production a promising alternative for achieving higher yields. Currently, there is no industrially relevant microbial fermentation process for β-cryptoxanthin production, primarily due to the lack of identified enzymes that specifically convert β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin without further conversion to zeaxanthin. In this study, we used genetic engineering to leverage the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a bio-factory for zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin production. We screened 22 β-carotene hydroxylases and identified eight novel enzymes with β-carotene hydroxylating activity: six producing zeaxanthin and two producing only β-cryptoxanthin. By introducing the β-carotene hydroxylase from the bacterium Chondromyces crocatus (CcBCH), a β-cryptoxanthin titer of 24 ± 6 mg/L was achieved, representing the highest reported titer of sole β-cryptoxanthin in Y. lipolytica to date. By targeting zeaxanthin-producing β-carotene hydroxylase to the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, we increased the production of zeaxanthin by 54% and 66%, respectively, compared to untargeted enzyme. The highest zeaxanthin titer of 412 ± 34 mg/L was achieved by targeting β-carotene hydroxylases to peroxisomes. In addition, by constructing multienzyme scaffold-free complexes with short peptide tags RIDD and RIAD, we observed a 39% increase in the zeaxanthin titer and a 28% increase in the conversion rate compared to the strain expressing unmodified enzyme. The zeaxanthin titers obtained in this study are not the highest reported; however, our goal was to demonstrate that specific approaches can enhance both titer and conversion rate, rather than to achieve the maximum titer. These findings underscore the potential of Y. lipolytica as a promising platform for carotenoid production and provide a foundation for future research, where further optimization is required to maximize production.

Title: Synthesis of β-ionone from xylose and lignocellulosic hydrolysate in genetically engineered oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: β-ionone, an apocarotenoid derived from a C40 terpenoid has an intense, woody smell and a low odor threshold that has been widely used in as an ingredient in food and cosmetics. Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising host for β-ionone production because of its oleaginous nature, its ability to produce high levels of acetyl-CoA (an important precursor for terpenoids), and the availability of synthetic biology tools to engineer the organism. In this study, β-carotene-producing Y. lipolytica strain XK17 was employed for β-ionone biosynthesis. First, we explored the effect of different sources of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) genes on β-ionone production. A high-yielding strain rUinO-D14 with 122 mg/L of β-ionone was obtained by screening promoters combined with rDNA mediated multi-round iterative transformations to optimize the expression of the CCD gene of Osmanthus fragrans. Second, to further develop a high-level production strain for β-ionone, we optimized key genes in the mevalonate pathway by multi-round iterative transformations mediated by non-homologous end joining, combined with a protein tagging strategy. Finally, the introduction of a heterologous oxidoreductase pathway enabled the engineered Y. lipolytica strain to use xylose as a sole carbon source and produce β-ionone. In addition, the potential for use of lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the carbon source for β-ionone production showed that the NHA-A31 strain had a high β-ionone productivity level. This study demonstrates that engineered Y. lipolytica can be used for the efficient, green and sustainable production of β-ionone.

Title: Broadening the application of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> synthetic biology tools to explore the potential of <i>Yarrowia</i> clade diversity.
Abstract: Yeasts have established themselves as prominent microbial cell factories, and the availability of synthetic biology tools has led to breakthroughs in the rapid development of industrial chassis strains. The selection of a suitable microbial host is critical in metabolic engineering applications, but it has been largely limited to a few well-defined strains. However, there is growing consideration for evaluating strain diversity, as a wide range of specific traits and phenotypes have been reported even within a specific yeast genus or species. Moreover, with the advent of synthetic biology tools, non-type strains can now be easily and swiftly reshaped. The yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> has been extensively studied for various applications such as fuels, chemicals, and food. Additionally, other members of the <i>Yarrowia</i> clade are currently being evaluated for their industrial potential. In this study, we demonstrate the versatility of synthetic biology tools originally developed for <i>Y. lipolytica</i> by repurposing them for engineering other yeasts belonging to the <i>Yarrowia</i> clade. Leveraging the Golden Gate <i>Y. lipolytica</i> tool kit, we successfully expressed fluorescent proteins as well as the carotenoid pathway in at least five members of the clade, serving as proof of concept. This research lays the foundation for conducting more comprehensive investigations into the uncharacterized strains within the <i>Yarrowia</i> clade and exploring their potential applications in biotechnology.

Title: Optimizing multicopy chromosomal integration for stable high-performing strains.
Abstract: The copy number of genes in chromosomes can be modified by chromosomal integration to construct efficient microbial cell factories but the resulting genetic systems are prone to failure or instability from triggering homologous recombination in repetitive DNA sequences. Finding the optimal copy number of each gene in a pathway is also time and labor intensive. To overcome these challenges, we applied a multiple nonrepetitive coding sequence calculator that generates sets of coding DNA sequence (CDS) variants. A machine learning method was developed to calculate the optimal copy number combination of genes in a pathway. We obtained an engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain for eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis in 6 months, producing the highest titer of 27.5 g l<sup>-1</sup> in a 50-liter bioreactor. Moreover, the lycopene production in Escherichia coli was also greatly improved. Importantly, all engineered strains of Y. lipolytica, E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae constructed with nonrepetitive CDSs maintained genetic stability.

Title: The bioproduction of astaxanthin: A comprehensive review on the microbial synthesis and downstream extraction.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a valuable orange-red carotenoid with wide applications in agriculture, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals areas. At present, the biological synthesis of astaxanthin mainly relies on Haematococcus pluvialis and Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. With the rapid development of synthetic biology, more recombinant microbial hosts have been genetically constructed for astaxanthin production including Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica. As multiple genes (15) were involved in the astaxanthin synthesis, it is particularly important to adopt different strategies to balance the metabolic flow towards the astaxanthin synthesis. Furthermore, astaxanthin is a fat-soluble compound stored intracellularly, hence efficient extraction methods are also essential for the economical production of astaxanthin. Several efficient and green extraction methods of astaxanthin have been reported in recent years, including the superfluid extraction, ionic liquid extraction and microwave-assisted extraction. Accordingly, this review will comprehensively introduce the advances on the astaxanthin production and extraction by using different microbial hosts and strategies to improve the astaxanthin synthesis and extraction efficiency.

Title: Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals the redirection of metabolic flux from cell growth to astaxanthin biosynthesis in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Engineering Yarrowia lipolytica to produce astaxanthin provides a promising route. Here, Y. lipolytica M2 producing a titer of 181 mg/L astaxanthin was isolated by iterative atmospheric and room-temperature plasma mutagenesis and diphenylamine-mediated screening. Interestingly, a negative correlation was observed between cell biomass and astaxanthin production. To reveal the underlying mechanism, RNA-seq analysis of transcriptional changes was performed in high producer M2 and reference strain M1, and a total of 1379 differentially expressed genes were obtained. Data analysis revealed that carbon flux was elevated through lipid metabolism, acetyl-CoA and mevalonate supply, but restrained through central carbon metabolism in strain M2. Moreover, upregulation of other pathways such as ATP-binding cassette transporter and thiamine pyrophosphate possibly provided more cofactors for carotenoid hydroxylase and relieved cell membrane stress caused by astaxanthin insertion. These results suggest that balancing cell growth and astaxanthin production may be important to promote efficient biosynthesis of astaxanthin in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Metabolic Pathway Coupled with Fermentation Process Optimization for High-Level Production of Retinol in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Retinol is a lipid-soluble form of vitamin A that is crucial for human visual and immune functions. The production of retinol through microbial fermentation has been the focus of recent exploration. However, the obtained titer remains limited and the product is often a mixture of retinal, retinol, and retinoic acid, necessitating purification. To achieve efficient biosynthesis of retinol in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, we improved the metabolic flux of β-carotene to provide sufficient precursors for retinol in this study. Coupled with the optimization of the expression level of β-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, <i>de novo</i> production of retinol was achieved. Furthermore, Tween 80 was used as an extractant and butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant to extract intracellular retinol and prevent retinol oxidation, respectively. This strategy significantly increased the level of retinol production. By optimizing the enzymes converting retinal to retinol, the proportion of extracellular retinol in the produced retinoids reached 100%, totaling 1042.3 mg/L. Finally, total retinol production reached 5.4 g/L through fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor, comprising 4.2 g/L extracellular retinol and 1.2 g/L intracellular retinol. This achievement represents the highest reported titer so far and advances the industrial production of retinol.

Title: Construction and Regulation of the Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant hormone with a variety of physiological functions such as regulating plant growth and helping plants to resist an adverse growth environment. However, at present, the ABA yield of heterologous biosynthesis by metabolic engineering is still low for industrial production. Therefore, five <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> genes (<i>bcaba1</i>, <i>bcaba2</i>, <i>bcaba3</i>, <i>bcaba4,</i> and <i>bccpr1</i>) related to ABA biosynthesis were expressed in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> PO1h; its ABA production was 24.33 mg/L. By increasing the copy number of <i>IDI</i> and <i>ERG12S</i>, <i>ERG20Y</i><i><sub>MT</sub></i>, and <i>bcaba3</i>, <i>bcaba1</i> genes, the yield of ABA was increased to 54.51 mg/L. By locating HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase in mitochondria, acetyl-CoA in mitochondria was converted into mevalonate; this increased the ABA yield to 102.12 mg/L. Finally, in the fed-batch fermentation process with the addition of dodecane, the ABA yield was up to 1212.57 mg/L, which is the highest yield of heterologous production of ABA by metabolic engineering.

Title: De Novo Biosynthesis of Lutein in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Lutein is a high-value tetraterpenoid carotenoid that is widely used in feed, cosmetics, food, and drugs. Microbial synthesis of lutein is an important method for green and sustainable production, serving as an alternative to plant extraction methods. However, an inadequate precursor supply and low catalytic efficiency of key pathway enzymes are the main reasons for the low efficacy of microbial synthesis of lutein. In this study, some strategies, such as enhancing the MVA pathway and localizing α-carotene synthase OluLCY within the subcellular organelles in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, were adopted to enhance the synthesis of precursor α-carotene, which resulted in a 10.50-fold increase in α-carotene titer, reaching 38.50 mg/L. Subsequently, by improving hydroxylase activity with truncated N-terminal transport peptide and locating hydroxylases to subcellular organelles, the final strain L9 producing 75.25 mg/L lutein was obtained. Eventually, a lutein titer of 675.40 mg/L (6.13 mg/g DCW) was achieved in a 5 L bioreactor by adding the antioxidant 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol. This study realizes <i>de novo</i> synthesis of lutein in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> for the first time and achieves the highest lutein titer reported so far.

Title: Unlocking the potential of one-carbon gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CO) for concomitant bioproduction of β-carotene and lipids.
Abstract: This study investigates the use of a Yarrowia lipolytica strain for the bioconversion of syngas-derived acetic acid into β-carotene and lipids. A two-stage process was employed, starting with the acetogenic fermentation of syngas by Clostridium aceticum, metabolising CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, to produce acetic acid, which is then utilized by Y. lipolytica for simultaneous lipid and β-carotene synthesis. The research demonstrates that acetic acid concentration plays a pivotal role in modulating lipid profiles and enhancing β-carotene production, with increased acetic acid consumption leading to higher yields of these compounds. This approach showcases the potential of using one-carbon gases as substrates in bioprocesses for generating valuable bioproducts, providing a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to more conventional feedstocks and substrates, such as sugars.

Title: Integrated fermentative process for lipid and β-carotene production from acetogenic syngas fermentation using an engineered oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica yeast.
Abstract: An engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain was successfully employed to produce β-carotene and lipids from acetic acid, a product of syngas fermentation by Clostridium aceticum. The strain showed acetic acid tolerance up to concentrations of 20 g/L. Flask experiments yielded a peak lipid content of 33.7 % and β-carotene concentration of 13.6 mg/g under specific nutrient conditions. The study also investigated pH effects on production in bioreactors, revealing optimal lipid and β-carotene contents at pH 6.0, reaching 22.9 % and 44 mg/g, respectively. Lipid profiles were consistent across experiments, with C18:1 being the dominant compound at approximately 50 %. This research underscores a green revolution in bioprocessing, showing how biocatalysts can convert syngas, a potentially polluting byproduct, into valuable β-carotene and lipids with a Y. lipolytica strain.

Title: Metabolic Engineering of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for Zeaxanthin Production.
Abstract: Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid, a dihydroxy derivative of β-carotene. Zeaxanthin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective properties. In this study, <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> was used as a host for the efficient production of zeaxanthin. The strain <i>Y. lipolytica</i> PO1h was used to construct the following engineered strains for carotenoid production since it produced the highest β-carotene among the <i>Y. lipolytica</i> PO1h- and <i>Y. lipolytica</i> PEX17-HA-derived strains. By regulating the key nodes on the carotenoid pathway through wild and mutant enzyme comparison and successive modular assembly, the β-carotene concentration was improved from 19.9 to 422.0 mg/L. To provide more precursor mevalonate, heterologous genes <i>mvaE</i> and <i>mvaS</i><sub><i>MT</i></sub> were introduced to increase the production of β-carotene by 27.2% to the yield of 536.8 mg/L. The β-carotene hydroxylase gene <i>crtZ</i> was then transferred, resulting in a yield of zeaxanthin of 326.5 mg/L. The oxidoreductase RFNR1 and CrtZ were then used to further enhance zeaxanthin production, and the yield of zeaxanthin was up to 775.3 mg/L in YPD shake flask.

Title: Characterization of an efficient CRISPR-iCas9 system in Yarrowia lipolytica for the biosynthesis of carotenoids.
Abstract: The application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas (CRISPR-Cas9) technology in the genetic modification of Yarrowia lipolytica is challenged by low efficiency and low throughput. Here, a highly efficient CRISPR-iCas9 (with D147Y and P411T mutants) genetic manipulation tool was established for Y. lipolytica, which was further utilized to integrate carotene synthetic key genes and significantly improve the target product yield. First, CRISPR-iCas9 could shorten the time of genetic modification and enable the rapid knockout of nonsense suppressors. iCas9 can lead to more than 98% knockout efficiency for NHEJ-mediated repair after optimal target disruption of a single gene, 100% knockout efficiency for a single gene-guided version, and more than 80% knockout efficiency for multiple genes simultaneously in Y. lipolytica. Subsequently, this technology allowed for rapid one-step integration of large fragments (up to 9902-bp) of genes into chromosomes. Finally, YL-ABTG and YL-ABTG2Z were further constructed through CRISPR-iCas9 integration of key genes in a one-step process, resulting in a maximum β-carotene and zeaxanthin content of 3.12 mg/g and 2.33 mg/g dry cell weight, respectively. Therefore, CRISPR-iCas9 technology provides a feasible approach to genetic modification for efficient biosynthesis of biological compounds in Y. lipolytica. KEY POINTS: • iCas9 with D147Y and P411T mutants improved the CRISPR efficiency in Y. lipolytica. • CRISPR-iCas9 achieved efficient gene knockout and integration in Y. lipolytica. • CRISPR-iCas9 rapidly modified Y. lipolytica for carotenoid bioproduction.

Title: Concomitant Production of Erythritol and β-Carotene by Engineered <i><i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i></i>.
Abstract: While the expansion of the erythritol production industry has resulted in unprecedented production of yeast cells, it also suffers from a lack of effective utilization. β-Carotene is a value-added compound that can be synthesized by engineered <i><i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i></i>. Here, we first evaluated the production performance of erythritol-producing yeast strains under two different morphologies and then successfully constructed a chassis with yeast-like morphology by deleting <i>Mhy1</i> and <i>Cla4</i> genes. Subsequently, β-carotene synthesis pathway genes, <i>CarRA</i> and <i>CarB</i> from <i><i>Blakeslea trispora</i>,</i> were introduced to construct the β-carotene and erythritol coproducing <i><i>Y. lipolytica</i></i> strain ylmcc. The rate-limiting genes <i>GGS1</i> and <i>tHMG1</i> were overexpressed to increase the β-carotene yield by 45.32-fold compared with the strain ylmcc. However, increased β-carotene accumulation led to prolonged fermentation time; therefore, transporter engineering through overexpression of <i>YTH1</i> and <i>YTH3</i> genes was used to alleviate fermentation delays. Using batch fermentation in a 3 L bioreactor, this engineered <i><i>Y. lipolytica</i></i> strain produced erythritol with production, yield, and productivity values of 171 g/L, 0.56 g/g glucose, and 2.38 g/(L·h), respectively, with a concomitant β-carotene yield of 47.36 ± 0.06 mg/g DCW. The approach presented here improves the value of erythritol-producing cells and offers a low-cost technique to obtain hydrophobic terpenoids.

Title: [Advances in abscisic acid biosynthesis].
Abstract: Abscisic acid, a plant hormone that inhibits growth, is a key factor in balancing plant endogenous hormones and regulating growth and metabolism. Abscisic acid can improve the drought resistance and salt tolerance of crops, reduce fruit browning, reduce the incidence rate of malaria and stimulate insulin secretion, so it has a broad application potential in agriculture and medicine. Compared with traditional plant extraction and chemical synthesis, abscisic acid synthesis by microorganisms is an economic and sustainable route. At present, a lot of progress has been made in the synthesis of abscisic acid by natural microorganisms such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Cercospora rosea</i>, while the research on the synthesis of abscisic acid by engineered microorganisms is rarely reported. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> are common hosts for heterologous synthesis of natural products due to their advantages of clear genetic background, easy operation and friendliness for industrial production. Therefore, the heterologous synthesis of abscisic acid by microorganisms is a more promising production method. The author reviews the research on the heterologous synthesis of abscisic acid by microorganisms from five aspects: selection of chassis cells, screening and expression enhancement of key enzymes, regulation of cofactors, enhancement of precursor supply and promotion of abscisic acid efflux. Finally, the future development direction of this field is prospected.

Title: Conditional protein degradation in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> using the auxin-inducible degron.
Abstract: Conditional protein degradation is a powerful tool for controlled protein knockdown. The auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology uses a plant auxin to induce depletion of degron-tagged proteins, and it has been shown to be functional in several non-plant eukaryotes. In this study, we demonstrated AID-based protein knockdown in an industrially important oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. Using the mini-IAA7 (mIAA7) degron derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> IAA7, coupled with an <i>Oryza sativa</i> TIR1 (OsTIR1) plant auxin receptor F-box protein (expressed from the copper-inducible MT2 promoter), C-terminal degron-tagged superfolder GFP could be degraded in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> upon addition of copper and the synthetic auxin 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). However, leaky degradation of the degron-tagged GFP in the absence of NAA was also noted. This NAA-independent degradation was largely eliminated by replacing the wild-type OsTIR1 and NAA with the OsTIR1<sup>F74A</sup> variant and the auxin derivative 5-Ad-IAA, respectively. Degradation of the degron-tagged GFP was rapid and efficient. However, Western blot analysis revealed cellular proteolytic cleavage within the mIAA7 degron sequence, leading to the production of a GFP sub-population lacking an intact degron. The utility of the mIAA7/OsTIR1<sup>F74A</sup> system was further explored in controlled degradation of a metabolic enzyme, β-carotene ketolase, which converts β-carotene to canthaxanthin via echinenone. This enzyme was tagged with the mIAA7 degron and expressed in a β-carotene producing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> strain that also expressed OsTIR1<sup>F74A</sup> controlled by the MT2 promoter. By adding copper and 5-Ad-IAA at the time of culture inoculation, canthaxanthin production was found to be reduced by about 50% on day five compared to the control culture without adding 5-Ad-IAA. This is the first report that demonstrates the efficacy of the AID system in <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. Further improvement of AID-based protein knockdown in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> may be achieved by preventing proteolytic removal of the mIAA7 degron tag.

Title: Enhanced β-carotene production in Yarrowia lipolytica through the metabolic and fermentation engineering.
Abstract: β-Carotene is a kind of high-value tetraterpene compound, which shows various applications in medical, agricultural, and industrial areas owing to its antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, Yarrowia lipolytica was successfully metabolically modified through the construction and optimization of β-carotene biosynthetic pathway for β-carotene production. The β-carotene titer in the engineered strain Yli-C with the introduction of the carotenogenesis genes crtI, crtE, and crtYB can reach 34.5 mg/L. With the overexpression of key gene in the mevalonate pathway and the enhanced expression of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, the β-carotene titer of the engineered strain Yli-CAH reached 87 mg/L, which was 152% higher than that of the strain Yli-C. Through the further expression of the rate-limiting enzyme tHMGR and the copy number of β-carotene synthesis related genes, the β-carotene production of Yli-C2AH2 strain reached 117.5 mg/L. The final strain Yli-C2AH2 produced 2.7 g/L β-carotene titer by fed-batch fermentation in a 5.0-L fermenter. This research will greatly speed up the process of developing microbial cell factories for the commercial production of β-carotene. In this study, the β-carotene synthesis pathway in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica was enhanced, and the fermentation conditions were optimized for high β-carotene production.

Title: Using oils and fats to replace sugars as feedstocks for biomanufacturing: Challenges and opportunities for the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: More than 200 million tons of plant oils and animal fats are produced annually worldwide from oil, crops, and the rendered animal fat industry. Triacylglycerol, an abundant energy-dense compound, is the major form of lipid in oils and fats. While oils or fats are very important raw materials and functional ingredients for food or related products, a significant portion is currently diverted to or recovered as waste. To significantly increase the value of waste oils or fats and expand their applications with a minimal environmental footprint, microbial biomanufacturing is presented as an effective strategy for adding value. Though both bacteria and yeast can be engineered to use oils or fats as the biomanufacturing feedstocks, the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is presented as one of the most attractive platforms. Y. lipolytica is oleaginous, generally regarded as safe, demonstrated as a promising industrial producer, and has unique capabilities for efficient catabolism and bioconversion of lipid substrates. This review summarizes the major challenges and opportunities for Y. lipolytica as a new biomanufacturing platform for the production of value-added products from oils and fats. This review also discusses relevant cellular and metabolic engineering strategies such as fatty acid transport, fatty acid catabolism and bioconversion, redox balances and energy yield, cell morphology and stress response, and bioreaction engineering. Finally, this review highlights specific product classes including long-chain diacids, wax esters, terpenes, and carotenoids with unique synthesis opportunities from oils and fats in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Advances in the metabolic engineering of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for the production of <b>β</b>-carotene.
Abstract: β-Carotene is one kind of the most important carotenoids. The major functions of β-carotene include the antioxidant and anti-cardiovascular properties, which make it a growing market. Recently, the use of metabolic engineering to construct microbial cell factories to synthesize β-carotene has become the latest model for its industrial production. Among these cell factories, yeasts including <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> have attracted the most attention because of the: security, mature genetic manipulation tools, high flux toward carotenoids using the native mevalonate pathway and robustness for large-scale fermentation. In this review, the latest strategies for β-carotene biosynthesis, including protein engineering, promoters engineering and morphological engineering are summarized in detail. Finally, perspectives for future engineering approaches are proposed to improve β-carotene production.

Title: Heterologous Expression of the Plant-Derived Astaxanthin Biosynthesis Pathway in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for Glycosylated Astaxanthin Production.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a high-value red pigment and antioxidant widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. However, the hydrophobicity of astaxanthin causes its low bioavailability. Glycosylation can substantially increase the water solubility of astaxanthin, thus enhancing its bioavailability, photostability, and biological activities. In this study, we report for the first time the heterologous production of glycosylated astaxanthin in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. By appropriate removal of the chloroplast transit peptide, carotenoid 4-hydroxy-β-ring 4-dehydrogenase (HBFD) and carotenoid β-ring 4-dehydrogenase (CBFD) from <i>Adonis aestivalis</i> were expressed in a β-carotene-producing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> strain, resulting in astaxanthin production with a yield of 0.59 mg/L, 0.05 mg/g DCW. This is the first time to successfully construct a plant-derived astaxanthin synthesis pathway in yeast. Modularized assembly of CBFD and HBFD, replacement of the promoter upstream CBFD, increasing the precursor β-carotene supply, and regulating the expressions of CBFD and HBFD led to a 4.9-fold increase in astaxanthin production (3.46 mg/L). Finally, introduction of <i>crtX</i> from <i>Pantoea ananatis</i> ATCC 19321 into the astaxanthin-producing strain enabled glycosylated astaxanthin production, and the yield reached 1.47 mg/L, which is the highest yield of microbially produced glycosylated astaxanthin reported to date.

Title: Photobiological production of high-value pigments via compartmentalized co-cultures using Ca-alginate hydrogels.
Abstract: Engineered cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus can use light and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce sucrose, making it a promising candidate for use in co-cultures with heterotrophic workhorses. However, this process is challenged by the mutual stresses generated from the multispecies microbial culture. Here we demonstrate an ecosystem where S. elongatus is freely grown in a photo-bioreactor (PBR) containing an engineered heterotrophic workhorse (either β-carotene-producing Yarrowia lipolytica or indigoidine-producing Pseudomonas putida) encapsulated in calcium-alginate hydrogel beads. The encapsulation prevents growth interference, allowing the cyanobacterial culture to produce high sucrose concentrations enabling the production of indigoidine and β-carotene in the heterotroph. Our experimental PBRs yielded an indigoidine titer of 7.5 g/L hydrogel and a β-carotene titer of 1.3 g/L hydrogel, amounts 15-22-fold higher than in a comparable co-culture without encapsulation. Moreover, <sup>13</sup>C-metabolite analysis and protein overexpression tests indicated that the hydrogel beads provided a favorable microenvironment where the cell metabolism inside the hydrogel was comparable to that in a free culture. Finally, the heterotroph-containing hydrogels were easily harvested and dissolved by EDTA for product recovery, while the cyanobacterial culture itself could be reused for the next batch of immobilized heterotrophs. This co-cultivation and hydrogel encapsulation system is a successful demonstration of bioprocess optimization under photobioreactor conditions.

Title: Rapid Gene Target Tracking for Enhancing β-Carotene Production Using Flow Cytometry-Based High-Throughput Screening in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: β-Carotene is a provitamin A precursor and an important antioxidant that is used widely in the aquaculture, food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica has been demonstrated as a competitive producer microorganism for the production of hydrophobic β-carotene through rational engineering strategies. However, the limited understanding of the complexity of the metabolic network between carotenoid biosynthesis and other cellular processes has hampered further advancement. Genome-scale mutagenesis and high-throughput screening of mutagenesis libraries have been extensively employed in gene mining or in the identification of key targets associated with particular phenotypes. In this study, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting approach for the effective high-throughput screening of high-β-carotene-producing strains. Using this approach, millions of mutants were screened rapidly, and new gene targets involved in lipid metabolism, sterol metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response were identified. The disruption of the genes affecting fatty acid oxidation, lipid composition, and sterol transcriptional regulation (4CL-8, GCS, and YIsterTF) increased β-carotene significantly. By engineering these targets in a high-β-carotene production, a strain that produced 9.4 g/L β-carotene was constructed. Here, we used a flow cytometry approach to improve screening efficiency and eliminate the interference of intermediate metabolites. The targets obtained in this study can be used in studies focusing on metabolic engineering in the future for improving carotenoid production. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> β-Carotene is a high-value-added product that is widely used in the aquaculture, food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. In our previous study, Yarrowia lipolytica has been engineered extensively to produce β-carotene. To further improve its production, high-throughput screening and the identification of new beneficial gene targets are required. Herein, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting approach for the effective high-throughput screening of high-β-carotene-producing strains. Using this approach, millions of mutants were screened rapidly, and new gene targets involved in lipid metabolism, sterol metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response were identified. The disruption of the genes affecting fatty acid oxidation, lipid composition, and sterol transcriptional regulation (4CL-8, GCS, and YIsterTF) increased β-carotene significantly. By engineering these targets in a high-β-carotene production, a strain that produced 9.4 g/L β-carotene was constructed.

Title: Integrated pathway engineering and transcriptome analysis for improved astaxanthin biosynthesis in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a high value carotenoid with a broad range of commercial applications due to its superior antioxidant properties. In this study, β-carotene-producing <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> XK17 constructed in the lab was employed for astaxanthin biosynthesis. The catalytic effects of β-carotene ketolase CrtW and β-carotene hydroxylase CrtZ from various species were investigated. The PspCrtW from <i>Paracoccus</i> sp. and HpCrtZ<sup>#</sup> from <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> were confirmed to be the best combination in converting β-carotene. Several key bottlenecks in biomass and astaxanthin biosynthesis were effectively eliminated by optimizing the expression of the above enzymes and restoring uracil/leucine biosynthesis. In addition, the effects of astaxanthin biosynthesis on cell metabolism were investigated by integrated analysis of pathway modification and transcriptome information. After further optimization, strain DN30 was able to synthesize up to 730.3 mg/L astaxanthin in laboratory 5-L fermenter. This study provides a good metabolic strategy and a sustainable development platform for high-value carotenoid production.

Title: Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals a persistent null-hyphal phenotype that maintains high carotenoid production in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is a metabolic engineering host of growing industrial interest due to its ability to metabolize hydrocarbons, fatty acids, glycerol, and other renewable carbon sources. This dimorphic yeast undergoes a stress-induced transition to a multicellular hyphal state, which can negatively impact biosynthetic activity, reduce oxygen and nutrient mass transfer in cell cultures, and increase culture viscosity. Identifying mutations that prevent the formation of hyphae would help alleviate the bioprocess challenges that they create. To this end, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic knockouts that prevent the transition to hyphal morphology. The screen identified five mutants with a null-hyphal phenotype-ΔRAS2, ΔRHO5, ΔSFL1, ΔSNF2, and ΔPAXIP1. Of these hits, only ΔRAS2 suppressed hyphal formation in an engineered lycopene production strain over a multiday culture. The RAS2 knockout was also the only genetic disruption characterized that did not affect lycopene production, producing more than 5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> OD<sup>-1</sup> from a heterologous pathway with enhanced carbon flux through the mevalonate pathway. These data suggest that a ΔRAS2 mutant of Y. lipolytica could prove useful in engineering a metabolic engineering host of the production of carotenoids and other biochemicals.

Title: Golden Gate Multigene Assembly Method for Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has emerged as a powerful alternative for biolipid production due to its high capacity for lipid accumulation. Genetic engineering and synthetic biology are promoted forward to improve production and reroute metabolism for high-value compound synthesis. In this context, efficient, modular, and high-throughput compatible cloning and expression system are required to speed up and rationalize research in this field. Here, we present the fast and modular Golden Gate cloning strategy for the construction of multigene expression vectors and their transformation into Y. lipolytica. As an example, we used the heterologous expression of the carotenoid pathway by cloning three genes involved in this pathway in only one vector allowing reaching production of β-carotene after a single transformation.

Title: Efficient production of retinol in Yarrowia lipolytica by increasing stability using antioxidant and detergent extraction.
Abstract: The demand for bio-based retinol (vitamin A) is currently increasing, however its instability represents a major bottleneck in microbial production. Here, we developed an efficient method to selectively produce retinol in Yarrowia lipolytica. The β-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase (BCO) cleaves β-carotene into retinal, which is reduced to retinol by retinol dehydrogenase (RDH). Therefore, to produce retinol, we first generated β-carotene-producing strain based on a high-lipid-producer via overexpressing genes including heterologous β-carotene biosynthetic genes, GGS1<sup>F43I</sup> mutant of endogenous geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase isolated by directed evolution, and FAD1 encoding flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase, while deleting several genes previously known to be beneficial for carotenoid production. To produce retinol, 11 copies of BCO gene from marine bacterium 66A03 (Mb.Blh) were integrated into the rDNA sites of the β-carotene overproducer. The resulting strain produced more retinol than retinal, suggesting strong endogenous promiscuous RDH activity in Y. lipolytica. The introduction of Mb.Blh led to a considerable reduction in β-carotene level, but less than 5% of the consumed β-carotene could be detected in the form of retinal or retinol, implying severe degradation of the produced retinoids. However, addition of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) led to a >20-fold increase in retinol production, suggesting oxidative damage is the main cause of intracellular retinol degradation. Overexpression of GSH2 encoding glutathione synthetase further improved retinol production. Raman imaging revealed co-localization of retinol with lipid droplets, and extraction of retinol using Tween 80 was effective in improving retinol production. By combining BHT treatment and extraction using Tween 80, the final strain CJ2104 produced 4.86 g/L retinol and 0.26 g/L retinal in fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor, which is the highest retinol production titer ever reported. This study demonstrates that Y. lipolytica is a suitable host for the industrial production of bio-based retinol.

Title: Identification of genome integration sites for developing a CRISPR-based gene expression toolkit in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: With the rapid development of synthetic biology, the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has become an attractive microorganism for chemical production. To better optimize and reroute metabolic pathways, we have expanded the CRISPR-based gene expression toolkit of Y. lipolytica. By sorting the integration sites associated with high expression, new neutral integration sites associated with high expression and high integration efficiency were identified. Diverse genetic components, including promoters and terminators, were also characterized to expand the expression range. We found that in addition to promoters, the newly characterized terminators exhibited large variations in gene expression. These genetic components and integration sites were then used to regulate genes involved in the lycopene biosynthesis pathway, and different levels of lycopene production were achieved. The CRISPR-based gene expression toolkit developed in this study will facilitate the genetic engineering of Y. lipolytica.

Title: Pareto optimal metabolic engineering for the growth-coupled overproduction of sustainable chemicals.
Abstract: Our research aims to help industrial biotechnology develop a sustainable economy using green technology based on microorganisms and synthetic biology through two case studies that improve metabolic capacity in yeast models Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). We aim to increase the production capacity of beta-carotene (β-carotene) and succinic acid, which are among the highest market demands due to their versatile use in numerous consumer products. We performed simulations to identify in silico ranking of strains based on multiple objectives: the growth rate of yeast microorganisms, the number of used chromosomes, and the production capability of β-carotene (for Y. lipolytica) and succinate (for S. cerevisiae). Our multiobjective optimization methodology identified notable gene deletions by searching a vast solution space to highlight near-optimal strains on Pareto Fronts, balancing the above-cited three objectives. Moreover, preserving the metabolic constraints and the essential genes, this study produced robust results: seven significant strains of Y. lipolytica and seven strains of S. cerevisiae. We examined gene knockout to study the function of genes and pathways. In fact, by studying the frequently silenced genes, we found that when the GPH1 gene is knocked out in S. cerevisiae, the isocitrate lyase enzyme is activated, which converts the isocitrate into succinate. Our goals are to simplify and facilitate the in vitro processes. Hence, we present strains with the least possible number of knockout genes and solutions in which the genes are turned off on the same chromosome. Therefore, we present results where the constraints mentioned above are met, like the strains where only two genes are switched off and other strains where half of the knockout genes are on the same chromosome. This study offers solutions for developing an efficient in vitro mutagenesis for microorganisms and demonstrates the efficiency of multiobjective optimization in automatizing metabolic engineering processes.

Title: Production of abscisic acid in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone with applications in agriculture and human health. ABA can be produced by Botrytis cinerea, a plant pathogenic filamentous fungus. However, the cultivation process is lengthy and strain improvement by genetic engineering is difficult. Therefore, we engineered the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as an alternative host for ABA production. First, we expressed five B. cinerea genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (BcABA1,BcABA2,BcABA3,BcABA4 and BcCPR1) in a Y. lipolytica chassis with optimized mevalonate flux. The strain produced 59.2 mg/L of ABA in small-scale cultivation. Next, we expressed an additional copy of each gene in the strain, but only expression of additional copy of BcABA1 gene increased the ABA titer to 168.5 mg/L. We then integrated additional copies of the mevalonate pathway and ABA biosynthesis encoding genes, and we expressed plant ABA transporters resulting in an improved strain producing 263.5 mg/L and 9.1 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) ABA. Bioreactor cultivation resulted in a specific yield of 12.8 mg/g DCW ABA; however, surprisingly, the biomass level obtained in bioreactors was only 10.5 g DCW/L, with a lower ABA titer of 133.6 mg/L. While further optimization is needed, this study confirms Y. lipolytica as a potential alternative host for the ABA production.

Title: Optimization of microbial cell factories for astaxanthin production: Biosynthesis and regulations, engineering strategies and fermentation optimization strategies.
Abstract: The global market demand for natural astaxanthin is rapidly increasing owing to its safety, the potential health benefits, and the diverse applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. The major native producers of natural astaxanthin on industrial scale are the alga <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> and the yeast <i>Xanthopyllomyces dendrorhous</i>. However, the natural production via these native producers is facing challenges of limited yield and high cost of cultivation and extraction. Alternatively, astaxanthin production via metabolically engineered non-native microbial cell factories such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> is another promising strategy to overcome these limitations. In this review we summarize the recent scientific and biotechnological progresses on astaxanthin biosynthetic pathways, transcriptional regulations, the interrelation with lipid metabolism, engineering strategies as well as fermentation process control in major native and non-native astaxanthin producers. These progresses illuminate the prospects of producing astaxanthin by microbial cell factories on industrial scale.

Title: Production of High Levels of 3<i>S</i>,3'<i>S</i>-Astaxanthin in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> via Iterative Metabolic Engineering.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a highly value-added keto-carotenoid compound. The astaxanthin 3<i>S</i>,3'<i>S</i>-isomer is more desirable for food additives, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals due to health concerns about chemically synthesized counterparts with a mixture of three isomers. Biosynthesis of 3<i>S</i>,3'<i>S</i>-astaxanthin suffers from limited content and productivity. We engineered <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> to produce high levels of 3<i>S</i>,3'<i>S</i>-astaxanthin. We first assessed various β-carotene ketolases (CrtW) and β-carotene hydroxylases (CrtZ) from two algae and a plant. HpCrtW and HpCrtZ from <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> exhibited the strongest activity in converting β-carotene into astaxanthin in <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. We then fine-tuned the HpCrtW and HpCrtZ transcriptional expression by increasing the rounds of gene integration into the genome and applied a modular enzyme assembly of HpCrtW and HpCrtZ simultaneously. Next, we rescued leucine biosynthesis in the engineered <i>Y. lipolytica</i>, leading to a five-fold increase in biomass. The astaxanthin production achieved from these strategies was 3.3 g/L or 41.3 mg/g dry cell weight under fed-batch conditions, which is the highest level reported in microbial chassis to date. This study provides the potential for industrial production of 3<i>S</i>,3'<i>S</i>-astaxanthin, and this strategy empowers us to build a sustainable biorefinery platform for generating other value-added carotenoids in the future.

Title: Removal of lycopene substrate inhibition enables high carotenoid productivity in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Substrate inhibition of enzymes can be a major obstacle to the production of valuable chemicals in engineered microorganisms. Here, we show substrate inhibition of lycopene cyclase as the main limitation in carotenoid biosynthesis in Yarrowia lipolytica. To overcome this bottleneck, we exploit two independent approaches. Structure-guided protein engineering yields a variant, Y27R, characterized by complete loss of substrate inhibition without reduction of enzymatic activity. Alternatively, establishing a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-mediated flux flow restrictor also prevents the onset of substrate inhibition by diverting metabolic flux away from the inhibitory metabolite while maintaining sufficient flux towards product formation. Both approaches result in high levels of near-exclusive β-carotene production. Ultimately, we construct strains capable of producing 39.5 g/L β-carotene at a productivity of 0.165 g/L/h in bioreactor fermentations (a 1441-fold improvement over the initial strain). Our findings provide effective approaches for removing substrate inhibition in engineering pathways for efficient synthesis of natural products.

Title: Mapping of Nonhomologous End Joining-Mediated Integration Facilitates Genome-Scale Trackable Mutagenesis in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Genome-scale mutagenesis, phenotypic screening, and tracking the causal mutations is a powerful approach for genetic analysis. However, classic mutagenesis approaches require extensive effort to identify causal mutations. It is desirable to demonstrate a powerful approach for rapid trackable mutagenesis. Here, we mapped the distribution of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated integration for the first time and demonstrated that it can be used for constructing the genome-scale trackable mutagenesis library in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. The sequencing of 9.15 × 10<sup>5</sup> insertions showed that NHEJ-mediated integration inserted DNA randomly across the chromosomes, and the transcriptional regulatory regions exhibited integration preference. The insertions were located in both nucleosome-occupancy regions and nucleosome-free regions. Using NHEJ-mediated integration to construct the genome-scale mutagenesis library, the new targets that improved β-carotene biosynthesis and acetic acid tolerance were identified rapidly. This mutagenesis approach is readily applicable to other organisms with strong NHEJ preference and will contribute to cell factory construction.

Title: Morphological and Metabolic Engineering of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> to Increase β-Carotene Production.
Abstract: The oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> represents an environmentally friendly platform cell factory for β-carotene production. However, <i>Y. lipolytica</i> is a dimorphic species that can undergo a yeast-to-mycelium transition when exposed to stress. The mycelial form is unfavorable for industrial fermentation. In this study, β-carotene-producing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> strains were constructed via the integration of multiple copies of 13 genes related to the β-carotene biosynthesis pathway. The β-carotene content increased by 11.7-fold compared with the start strain T1. As the β-carotene content increased, the oval-shaped yeast form was gradually replaced by hyphae, implying that the accumulation of β-carotene in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> induces a morphological transition. To relieve this metabolic stress, the strains were morphologically engineered by deleting <i>CLA4</i> and <i>MHY1</i> genes to convert the mycelium back to the yeast form, which further increased the β-carotene production by 139%. In fed-batch fermentation, the engineered strain produced 7.6 g/L and 159 mg/g DCW β-carotene, which is the highest titer and content reported to date. The morphological engineering strategy developed here may be useful for enhancing chemical synthesis in dimorphic yeasts.

Title: Metabolic Engineering of Non-carotenoid-Producing Yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for the Biosynthesis of Zeaxanthin.
Abstract: Zeaxanthin is vital to human health; thus, its production has received much attention, and it is also an essential precursor for the biosynthesis of other critical carotenoids such as astaxanthin and crocetin. <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> is one of the most intensively studied non-conventional yeasts and has been genetically engineered as a cell factory to produce carotenoids such as lycopene and β-carotene. However, zeaxanthin production by <i>Y. lipolytica</i> has not been well investigated. To fill this gap, β-carotene biosynthesis pathway has been first constructed in this study by the expression of genes, including <i>crtE</i>, <i>crtB</i>, <i>crtI</i>, and <i>carRP</i>. Three <i>crtZ</i> genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylase from different organisms were individually introduced into β-carotene-producing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> to evaluate their performance for producing zeaxanthin. The expression of <i>crtZ</i> from the bacterium <i>Pantoea ananatis</i> (formerly <i>Erwinia uredovora, Eu-crtZ</i>) resulted in the highest zeaxanthin titer and content on the basis of dry cell weight (DCW). After verifying the function of <i>Eu-crtZ</i> for producing zeaxanthin, the high-copy-number integration into the ribosomal DNA of <i>Y. lipolytica</i> led to a 4.02-fold increase in the titer of zeaxanthin and a 721% increase in the content of zeaxanthin. The highest zeaxanthin titer achieved 21.98 ± 1.80 mg/L by the strain grown on a yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD)-rich medium. In contrast, the highest content of DCW reached 3.20 ± 0.11 mg/g using a synthetic yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium to culture the cells. Over 18.0 g/L of citric acid was detected in the supernatant of the YPD medium at the end of cultivation. Furthermore, the zeaxanthin-producing strains still accumulated a large amount of lycopene and β-carotene. The results demonstrated the potential of a cell factory for zeaxanthin biosynthesis and opened up an avenue to engineer this host for the overproduction of carotenoids.

Title: Targeting pathway expression to subcellular organelles improves astaxanthin synthesis in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Metabolic engineering approaches for the production of high-value chemicals in microorganisms mostly use the cytosol as general reaction vessel. However, sequestration of enzymes and substrates, and metabolic cross-talk frequently prevent efficient synthesis of target compounds in the cytosol. Organelle compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells suggests ways for overcoming these challenges. Here we have explored this strategy by expressing the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway in sub-organelles of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. We first showed that fusion of the two enzymes converting β-carotene to astaxanthin, β-carotene ketolase and hydroxylase, performs better than the expression of individual enzymes. We next evaluated the pathway when expressed in compartments of lipid body, endoplasmic reticulum or peroxisome, individually and in combination. Targeting the astaxanthin pathway to subcellular organelles not only accelerated the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin, but also significantly decreased accumulation of the ketocarotenoid intermediates. Anchoring enzymes simultaneously to all three organelles yielded the largest increase of astaxanthin synthesis, and ultimately produced 858 mg/L of astaxanthin in fed-batch fermentation (a 141-fold improvement over the initial strain). Our study is expected to help unlock the full potential of subcellular compartments and advance LB-based compartmentalized isoprenoid biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Enhanced β-carotene production by overexpressing the DID2 gene, a subunit of ESCRT complex, in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: β-Carotene has been widely used in the food and feed industry and has significant commercial value. This study aimed to increase the β-carotene production in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica by optimizing the host metabolic network. The DID2 gene, a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), was integrated into a β-carotene producing strain. The β-carotene production was increased by 260%, and the biomass increased by 10% for engineered Y. lipolytica. Meanwhile, DID2 elevated the mRNA level and protein level of the genes in the β-carotene synthesis pathway, then increased precursors (FPP, Lycopene) utilization. DID2 also increased the mRNA level of the genes in the glucose pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle and promoted glucose utilization and cofactors consumption. The ESCRT protein complex subunit, DID2, improved β-carotene production in engineered Y. lipolytica and beneficial to glucose utilization and cofactors consumption. This study provided new finding of the DID2 gene's function and it mostly could be used for many other natural product productions.

Title: Carotenoid Production in Oleaginous Yeasts.
Abstract: Oleaginous yeasts, Yarrowia lipolytica and Lipomyces starkeyi, can synthesize more than 20% of lipids per dry cell weight from a wide variety of substrates. This feature is attractive for cost-efficient production of industrial biodiesel fuel. These yeasts are also very promising hosts for the efficient production of more value-added lipophilic compound carotenoids, e.g., lycopene and astaxanthin, although they cannot naturally biosynthesize carotenoids. Here, we review recent progress in researches on carotenoid production by oleaginous yeasts, which include red yeasts that naturally produce carotenoids, e.g., Rhodotorula glutinis and Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. Our new results on pathway engineering of L. starkeyi for lycopene production are also revealed in the present review.

Title: Elevated β-Carotene Production Using Codon-Adapted CarRA&B and Metabolic Balance in Engineered <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: β-carotene is a precursor of vitamin A and has multiple physiological functions. Producing β-carotene by microbial fermentation has attracted much attention to consumers' preference for natural products. This study focused on improving β-carotene production by constructing codon-adapted genes and minimizing intermediate accumulation. The codon-adapted <i>CarRA</i> and <i>CarB</i> genes from the industrial strain of <i>Blakeslea trispora</i> were integrated into the genome of the <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> to construct YL-C0, the baseline strain for producing β-carotene. Thereafter, the β-carotene biosynthetic pathway's metabolic balance was accurately regulated to reduce the intermediates' accumulation. Notably, the β-carotene content increased by 21 times to reach 12.5 dry cell weight (DCW) mg/g when minimizing HMG-CoA and FPP accumulation. Further, we improved the expression levels of the <i>CarRA</i> and <i>CarB</i> genes to minimize the accumulation of phytoene and lycopene. Total production of β-carotene of 1.7 g/L and 21.6 mg/g DCW was achieved. These results reveal that the rate-limiting enzymes CarRA and CarB of <i>B. trispora</i> exhibited higher catalytic activity than the same enzymes from other microorganisms. Promoting metabolic balance by minimizing the accumulation of intermediates is a very effective strategy for increasing β-carotene. The β-carotene-producing strain constructed in this study has established the foundation for its potential use in industrial production. These successful engineering strategies also provide a foundation for large-scale production of other terpenoids.

Title: Establishment of genomic library technology mediated by non-homologous end joining mechanism in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Genomic variants libraries are conducive to obtain dominant strains with desirable phenotypic traits. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which enables foreign DNA fragments to be randomly integrated into different chromosomal sites, shows prominent capability in genomic libraries construction. In this study, we established an efficient NHEJ-mediated genomic library technology in Yarrowia lipolytica through regulation of NHEJ repair process, employment of defective Ura marker and optimization of iterative transformations, which enhanced genes integration efficiency by 4.67, 22.74 and 1.87 times, respectively. We further applied this technology to create high lycopene producing strains by multi-integration of heterologous genes of CrtE, CrtB and CrtI, with 23.8 times higher production than rDNA integration through homologous recombination (HR). The NHEJ-mediated genomic library technology also achieved random and scattered integration of loxP and vox sites, with the copy number up to 65 and 53, respectively, creating potential for further application of recombinase mediated genome rearrangement in Y. lipolytica. This work provides a high-efficient NHEJ-mediated genomic library technology, which enables random and scattered genomic integration of multiple heterologous fragments and rapid generation of diverse strains with superior phenotypes within 96 h. This novel technology also lays an excellent foundation for the development of other genetic technologies in Y. lipolytica.

Title: A CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated, Homology-Independent Tool Developed for Targeted Genome Integration in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> has been extensively used to produce essential chemicals and enzymes. As in most other eukaryotes, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> Although numerous studies have attempted to achieve targeted genome integration through homologous recombination (HR), this process requires the construction of homologous arms, which is time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a homology-independent and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted genome integration tool in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> Through optimization of the cleavage efficiency of Cas9, targeted integration of a <i>hyg</i> fragment was achieved with 12.9% efficiency, which was further improved by manipulation of the fidelity of NHEJ repair, the cell cycle, and the integration sites. Thus, the targeted integration rate reached 55% through G<sub>1</sub> phase synchronization. This tool was successfully applied for the rapid verification of intronic promoters and iterative integration of four genes in the pathway for canthaxanthin biosynthesis. This homology-independent integration tool does not require homologous templates and selection markers and achieves one-step targeted genome integration of the 8,417-bp DNA fragment, potentially replacing current HR-dependent genome-editing methods for <i>Y. lipolytica</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study describes the development and optimization of a homology-independent targeted genome integration tool mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> This tool does not require the construction of homologous templates and can be used to rapidly verify genetic elements and to iteratively integrate multiple-gene pathways in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> This tool may serve as a potential supplement to current HR-dependent genome-editing methods for eukaryotes.

Title: Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for production of β-carotene from hydrophobic substrates.
Abstract: β-Carotene is a yellow-orange-red pigment used in food, cosmetics and pharmacy. There is no commercial yeast-based process for β-carotene manufacturing. In this work, we engineered the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expression of lipases and carotenogenic genes to enable the production of β-carotene on hydrophobic substrates. First, the extracellular lipase (LIP2) and two cell-bound lipases (LIP7 and LIP8) from oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica were expressed either individually or in combination in S. cerevisiae. The engineered strains could grow on olive oil and triolein as the sole carbon source. The strain expressing all three lipases had ∼40% lipid content per dry weight. Next, we integrated the genes encoding β-carotene biosynthetic pathway, crtI, crtYB and crtE from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. The resulting engineered strain bearing the lipases and carotenogenic genes reached a titer of 477.9 mg/L β-carotene in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) olive oil, which was 12-fold higher than an analogous strain without lipases. The highest β-carotene content of 46.5 mg/g DCW was obtained in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) olive oil. The study demonstrates the potential of applying lipases and hydrophobic substrate supplementation for the production of carotenoids in S. cerevisiae.

Title: Dissolved-oxygen feedback control fermentation for enhancing β-carotene in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The DO-stat fed-batch fermentation was carried out to explore the volumetric productivity of β-carotene in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica C11 strain. Using DO-stat fed-batch fermentation, we achieved 94 g/L biomass and 2.01 g/L β-carotene. Both biomass and β-carotene were about 1.28-fold higher than that in fed-batch fermentation. The ATP, NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH, and gene expression levels of tHMG, GGS1, carRA, and carB were promoted as compared to that in fed-batch fermentation. As for as the kinetic parameters in DO-stat fed-batch fermentation, μ<sub>m</sub>', Y<sub>x/s</sub>', and Y<sub>p/s</sub>' was 0.527, 0.353, and 0.158, respectively. The μ<sub>m</sub>' was elevated 4.66-fold than that in fed-batch fermentation. These data illustrate that more dissolved oxygen increased the biomass. The Y<sub>x/s</sub>' and Y<sub>p/s</sub>' were increased 1.15 and 22.57-fold, which suggest that the DO-stat fed-batch fermentation reduced the Crabtree effect and improved the utilization rate of glucose. Therefore, DO-stat fed-batch fermentation is a promising strategy in the industrialized production of β-carotene.

Title: <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> Strains Engineered for the Production of Terpenoids.
Abstract: Terpenoids are a diverse group of over 55,000 compounds with potential applications as advanced fuels, bulk and fine chemicals, pharmaceutical ingredients, agricultural chemicals, etc. To facilitate their bio-based production, there is a need for plug-and-play hosts, capable of high-level production of different terpenoids. Here we engineer <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> platform strains for the overproduction of mono-, sesqui-, di-, tri-, and tetraterpenoids. The monoterpene platform strain was evaluated by expressing <i>Perilla frutescens</i> limonene synthase, which resulted in limonene titer of 35.9 mg/L and was 100-fold higher than when the same enzyme was expressed in the strain without mevalonate pathway improvement. Expression of <i>Callitropsis nootkatensis</i> valencene synthase in the sesquiterpene platform strain resulted in 113.9 mg/L valencene, an 8.4-fold increase over the control strain. Platform strains for production of squalene, complex triterpenes, or diterpenes and carotenoids were also constructed and resulted in the production of 402.4 mg/L squalene, 22 mg/L 2,3-oxidosqualene, or 164 mg/L β-carotene, respectively. The presented terpenoid platform strains can facilitate the evaluation of terpenoid biosynthetic pathways and are a convenient starting point for constructing efficient cell factories for the production of various terpenoids. The platform strains and exemplary terpenoid strains can be obtained from Euroscarf.

Title: Construction of wild-type Yarrowia lipolytica IMUFRJ 50682 auxotrophic mutants using dual CRISPR/Cas9 strategy for novel biotechnological approaches.
Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica IMUFRJ 50682 is a Brazilian wild-type strain with potential application in bioconversion processes which can be improved through synthetic biology. In this study, we focused on a combinatorial dual cleavage CRISPR/Cas9-mediated for construction of irreversible auxotrophic mutants IMUFRJ 50682, which genomic information is not available, thought paired sgRNAs targeting upstream and downstream sites of URA3 gene. The disruption efficiency ranged from 5 to 28 % for sgRNAs combinations closer to URA3's start and stop codon and the auxotrophic mutants lost about 970 bp containing all coding sequence, validating this method for genomic edition of wild-type strains. In addition, we introduced a fluorescent phenotype and achieved cloning rates varying from 80 to 100 %. The ura3Δ strains IMUFRJ 50682 were also engineered for β-carotene synthesis as proof of concept. Carotenoid-producing strains exhibited a similar growth profile compared to the wild-type strain and were able to synthesized 30.54-50.06 mg/L (up to 4.8 mg/g DCW) of β-carotene in YPD and YNB flask cultures, indicating a promisor future of the auxotrophic mutants IMUFRJ 50682 as a chassis for production of novel value-added chemicals.

Title: Promoting the Synthesis of Precursor Substances by Overexpressing Hexokinase (Hxk) and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase (Erg13) to Elevate β-Carotene Production in Engineered <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: As a valuable carotenoid, β-carotene is commercially used in food, cosmetics, animal feeds, and other industries. Metabolic engineering of microorganisms has been widely explored to improve the production of β-carotene. Compared with the traditional genetic modifications mainly focused on the pathways of mevalonate (MVA) and β-carotene biosynthesis, this study aims to increase the β-carotene production through promoting the synthesis of precursor substances by overexpressing hexokinase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase in an engineered <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. In this study, we investigated the effect of the unique hexokinase gene (<i>Hxk</i>) overexpression on β-carotene accumulation and glucose consumption. The <i>Hxk</i> gene was introduced into a β-carotene producing strain Y.L-1 to generate strain Y.L-2, and this increased the β-carotene content by 98%. Overexpression of the <i>Hxk</i> gene led to increasing in hexokinase activity (329% higher), glucose-6-phosphate content (92% higher), and improvement of the transcriptional level of <i>Hxk</i> (315% higher) compared to the control Y.L-1 strain. Moreover, <i>Hxk</i> overexpression accelerated the utilization rate of glucose. The gene <i>erg13</i> encoding hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase was also overexpressed to increase the precursor supply for β-carotene biosynthesis. Recombinant Y.L-4 harboring two copies of <i>erg13</i> produced 8.41 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) of β-carotene, which was 259% higher than Y.L-1. The β-carotene content of 9.56 mg/g DCW was achieved in strain Y.L-6 by integrating <i>erg13</i> into the chromosome and <i>Hxk</i> overexpression. The 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA content in the cells was increased by overexpressing two copies of the <i>erg13</i> gene. Finally, the titer of β-carotene reached 2.4 g/L using a 50 L bioreactor by the engineered strain, and the fermentation cycle was shortened from 144 to 120 h. Overall, overexpression of <i>Hxk</i> and <i>erg13</i> could improve β-carotene production and successfully overcoming the bottleneck of precursor generation to support a more efficient pathway for the production of the target product. Our results revealed a novel strategy to engineer the pathway of β-carotene synthesis.

Title: Production and excretion of astaxanthin by engineered Yarrowia lipolytica using plant oil as both the carbon source and the biocompatible extractant.
Abstract: This study aimed to develop a bioprocess using plant oil as the carbon source for lipid-assimilating yeast to produce high-value astaxanthin. Using high-oleic safflower oil as a model, efficient cell growth and astaxanthin production by the engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain ST7403 was demonstrated, and a considerable portion of astaxanthin was found excreted into the spent oil. Astaxanthin was the predominant carotenoid in the extracellular oil phase that allowed facile in situ recovery of astaxanthin without cell lysis. Autoclaving the safflower oil medium elevated the peroxide level but it declined quickly during fermentation (reduced by 84% by day 3) and did not inhibit cell growth or astaxanthin production. In a 1.5-L fed-batch bioreactor culture with a YnB-based medium containing 20% safflower oil, and with the feeding of casamino acids, astaxanthin production reached 54 mg/L (53% excreted) in 28 days. Further improvement in astaxanthin titer and productivity was achieved by restoring leucine biosynthesis in the host, and running fed-batch fermentation using a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio yeast extract/peptone medium containing 70% safflower oil, with feeding of additional yeast extract/peptone, to attain 167 mg/L astaxanthin (48% excreted) in 9.5 days of culture. These findings facilitate industrial microbial biorefinery development that utilizes renewable lipids as feedstocks to not only produce high-value products but also effectively extract and recover the products, including non-native ones.Key Points• Yarrowia lipolytica can use plant oil as a C-source for astaxanthin production.• Astaxanthin is excreted and accumulated in the extracellular oil phase.• Astaxanthin is the predominant carotenoid in the extracellular oil phase.• Plant oil serves as a biocompatible solvent for in situ astaxanthin extraction.

Title: Analysis of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> growth, catabolism, and terpenoid biosynthesis during utilization of lipid-derived feedstock.
Abstract: This study employs biomass growth analyses and <sup>13</sup>C-isotope tracing to investigate lipid feedstock utilization by <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. Compared to glucose, oil-feedstock in the minimal medium increases the yeast's biomass yields and cell sizes, but decreases its protein content (<20% of total biomass) and enzyme abundances for product synthesis. Labeling results indicate a segregated metabolic network (the glycolysis vs. the TCA cycle) during co-catabolism of sugars (glucose or glycerol) with fatty acid substrates, which facilitates resource allocations for biosynthesis without catabolite repressions. This study has also examined the performance of a β-carotene producing strain in different growth mediums. Canola oil-containing yeast-peptone (YP) has resulted in the best β-carotene titer (121 ± 13 mg/L), two-fold higher than the glucose based YP medium. These results highlight the potential of <i>Y. lipolytica</i> for the valorization of waste-derived lipid feedstock.

Title: Recombinant β-Carotene Production by <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> - Assessing the Potential of Micro-Scale Fermentation Analysis in Cell Factory Design and Bioreaction Optimization.
Abstract: The production of β-carotene has become increasingly interesting within the biotechnological industry due to a rising demand for safer and more natural colorants, nutritional supplements, and antioxidants. A recent study has described the potential of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> as a β-carotene-producing cell factory, reporting the highest titer of recombinant β-carotene produced to date. Finding the best conditions to maximize production and scaling up the process to full scale, a costly and time-consuming process, it is often a bottleneck in biotechnology. In this work, we explored the benefits of using micro-fermentation equipment to significantly reduce the time spent on design and optimization of bioreaction conditions, especially in the early stages of process development. In this proof-of-concept study, a β-carotene producing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> strain was tested in micro-fermentations partly to assess the robustness of the cell factory design and partly to perform media optimization. The medium optimization led us to an improvement of up to 50% in the yield of β-carotene production in the best of the conditions. Overall, the micro-fermentation system had a high degree of reliability in all tests.

Title: A modular pathway engineering strategy for the high-level production of β-ionone in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The GRAS and oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) is an attractive cell factory for the production of chemicals and biofuels. The production of many natural products of commercial interest have been investigated in this cell factory by introducing heterologous biosynthetic pathways and by modifying the endogenous pathways. However, since natural products anabolism involves long pathways and complex regulation, re-channelling carbon into the product of target compounds is still a cumbersome work, and often resulting in low production performance. In this work, the carotenogenic genes contained carB and bi-functional carRP from Mucor circinelloides and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) from Petunia hybrida were introduced to Y. lipolytica and led to the low production of β-ionone of 3.5 mg/L. To further improve the β-ionone synthesis, we implemented a modular engineering strategy for the construction and optimization of a biosynthetic pathway for the overproduction of β-ionone in Y. lipolytica. The strategy involved the enhancement of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA supply and the increase of MVA pathway flux, yielding a β-ionone titer of 358 mg/L in shake-flask fermentation and approximately 1 g/L (~ 280-fold higher than the baseline strain) in fed-batch fermentation. An efficient β-ionone producing GRAS Y. lipolytica platform was constructed by combining integrated overexpressed of heterologous and native genes. A modular engineering strategy involved the optimization pathway and fermentation condition was investigated in the engineered strain and the highest β-ionone titer reported to date by a cell factory was achieved. This effective strategy can be adapted to enhance the biosynthesis of other terpenoids in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Metabolic engineering of β-carotene biosynthesis in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Carotenoids, as potent antioxidant compounds, have gained extensive attention, especially in human health. In this study, the combination of CRISPR/Cas9 integration strategy and fermenter cultivation was utilized to obtain efficient β-carotene-producing Yarrowia lipolytica cell factories for potential industrial application. The introduction of the genes of Mucor circinelloides, encoding phytoene dehydrogenase (carB) and bifunctional phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase (carRP), contributed to the heterologous production of β-carotene in Y. lipolytica XK2. Furthermore, β-carotene production was efficiently enhanced by increasing the copy numbers of the carB and carRP genes and overexpressing of GGS1, ERG13, and HMG, the genes related to the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Thus, the optimized strain overexpressed a total of eight genes, including three copies of carRP, two copies of carB, and single copies of GGS1, HMG, and ERG13. As a consequence, strain Y. lipolytica XK19 accumulated approximately 408 mg/L β-carotene in shake flask cultures, a twenty-four-fold increase compared to the parental strain Y. lipolytica XK2. 4.5 g/L β-carotene was obtained in a 5-L fermenter through a combination of genetic engineering and culture optimization, suggesting a great capacity and flexibility of Y. lipolytica in the production of carotenoids.

Title: Engineering yeast artificial core promoter with designated base motifs.
Abstract: Synthetic biology requires toolbox of promoters to finely tune gene expression levels for building up efficient cell factories. Yeast promoters owned variable core promoter regions between the TATA-box and transcriptional starting site (TSS) at the length mostly around 20-80 bases. This region allowed flexible design of artificial promoter but potentially demand special base motifs to maintain or enhance the promoter's strength. Here, we designed and screened the base motifs and tested the activities of yeast artificial core promoters. Different 30 bases of artificial sequences led to variable expression levels of CrtY enzyme which determined the lycopene-carotene compositions, represented in the colony-color spectrum of red-orange-yellow. The upstream sequences of two strong promoter P<sub>EXP1</sub> and P<sub>GPD</sub> and two starting strains with distinguishable lycopene production levels were utilized to characterize the promoter sequences. Different partition designs of T-rich or G/C-rich base motifs led to distinguishable colony-color distributions. Finally, we screened a champion promoter with a highest 5.5-fold enhancement of lycopene-carotene transformation. Another selected promoter generated a highest beta-carotene production as 7.4 mg/g DCW. This work offered an approach to redesign promoter with artificial sequences. We concluded that the core promoter region could be designated as 30 bases and different base motifs would enhance or weaken the promoter's strength. Generally, more T-rich elements, higher %T and lower G/C percentage were beneficial to enhance the strength of artificial core promoter.

Abstract: Microbial production of fuels and chemicals offers a means by which sustainable product manufacture can be achieved. In this regard, Yarrowia lipolytica is a unique microorganism suitable for a diverse array of biotechnological applications. As a robust oleaginous yeast, it has been well studied for production of fuels and chemicals derived from fatty acids. However, thanks in part to newfound genetic tools and metabolic understanding, Y. lipolytica has been explored for high-level production of a variety of non-lipid products. This mini-review will discuss some of the recent research surrounding the ability of Y. lipolytica to support bio-based chemical production outside the realm of fatty acid metabolism including polyketides, terpenes, carotenoids, pentose phosphate-derived products, polymers, and nanoparticles.

Title: Enhancement of Astaxanthin Biosynthesis in Oleaginous Yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> via Microalgal Pathway.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a high-value red pigment and antioxidant used by pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. The astaxanthin produced chemically is costly and is not approved for human consumption due to the presence of by-products. The astaxanthin production by natural microalgae requires large open areas and specialized equipment, the process takes a long time, and results in low titers. Recombinant microbial cell factories can be engineered to produce astaxanthin by fermentation in standard equipment. In this work, an oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> was engineered to produce astaxanthin at high titers in submerged fermentation. First, a platform strain was created with an optimised pathway towards β-carotene. The platform strain produced 331 ± 66 mg/L of β-carotene in small-scale cultivation, with the cellular content of 2.25% of dry cell weight. Next, the genes encoding β-ketolase and β-hydroxylase of bacterial (<i>Paracoccus sp</i>. and <i>Pantoea ananatis</i>) and algal (<i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i>) origins were introduced into the platform strain in different copy numbers. The resulting strains were screened for astaxanthin production, and the best strain, containing algal β-ketolase and β-hydroxylase, resulted in astaxanthin titer of 44 ± 1 mg/L. The same strain was cultivated in controlled bioreactors, and a titer of 285 ± 19 mg/L of astaxanthin was obtained after seven days of fermentation on complex medium with glucose. Our study shows the potential of <i>Y. lipolytica</i> as the cell factory for astaxanthin production.

Title: A teaching protocol demonstrating the use of EasyClone and CRISPR/Cas9 for metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: We present a teaching protocol suitable for demonstrating the use of EasyClone and CRISPR/Cas9 for metabolic engineering of industrially relevant yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica, using β-carotene production as a case study. The protocol details all steps required to generate DNA parts, transform and genotype yeast, and perform a phenotypic screen to determine β-carotene production. The protocol is intended to be used as an instruction manual for a two-week practical course aimed at M.Sc. and Ph.D. students. The protocol details all necessary steps for students to engineer yeast to produce β-carotene and serves as a practical introduction to the principles of metabolic engineering including the concepts of boosting native precursor supply and alleviating rate-limiting steps. It also highlights key differences in the metabolism and heterologous production capacity of two industrially relevant yeast species. The protocol is divided into daily experiments covering a two-week period and provides detailed instructions for every step meaning this protocol can be used 'as is' for a teaching course or as a case study for how yeast can be engineered to produce value-added molecules.

Title: Multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9-Based Genome Editing of <i>Rhodosporidium toruloides</i>.
Abstract: Microbial production of biofuels and bioproducts offers a sustainable and economic alternative to petroleum-based fuels and chemicals. The basidiomycete yeast <i>Rhodosporidium toruloides</i> is a promising platform organism for generating bioproducts due to its ability to consume a broad spectrum of carbon sources (including those derived from lignocellulosic biomass) and to naturally accumulate high levels of lipids and carotenoids, two biosynthetic pathways that can be leveraged to produce a wide range of bioproducts. While <i>R. toruloides</i> has great potential, it has a more limited set of tools for genetic engineering relative to more advanced yeast platform organisms such as <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Significant advancements in the past few years have bolstered <i>R. toruloides</i>' engineering capacity. Here we expand this capacity by demonstrating the first use of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene disruption in <i>R. toruloides</i> Transforming a Cas9 expression cassette harboring nourseothricin resistance and selecting transformants on this antibiotic resulted in strains of <i>R. toruloides</i> exhibiting successful targeted disruption of the native <i>URA3</i> gene. While editing efficiencies were initially low (0.002%), optimization of the cassette increased efficiencies 364-fold (to 0.6%). Applying these optimized design conditions enabled disruption of another native gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, <i>CAR2</i>, with much greater success; editing efficiencies of <i>CAR2</i> deletion reached roughly 50%. Finally, we demonstrated efficient multiplexed genome editing by disrupting both <i>CAR2</i> and <i>URA3</i> in a single transformation. Together, our results provide a framework for applying CRISPR-Cas9 to <i>R. toruloides</i> that will facilitate rapid and high-throughput genome engineering in this industrially relevant organism.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbial biofuel and bioproduct platforms provide access to clean and renewable carbon sources that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than petroleum-based carbon sources. Furthermore, they can serve as useful conduits for the synthesis of advanced molecules that are difficult to produce through strictly chemical means. <i>R. toruloides</i> has emerged as a promising potential host for converting renewable lignocellulosic material into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, engineering efforts to improve the yeast's production capabilities have been impeded by a lack of advanced tools for genome engineering. While this is rapidly changing, one key tool remains unexplored in <i>R. toruloides</i>: CRISPR-Cas9. The results outlined here demonstrate for the first time how effective multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption provides a framework for other researchers to utilize this revolutionary genome-editing tool effectively in <i>R. toruloides</i>.

Title: Cellular and metabolic engineering of oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for bioconversion of hydrophobic substrates into high-value products.
Abstract: The non-conventional oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> is able to utilize both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon sources as substrates and convert them into value-added bioproducts such as organic acids, extracellular proteins, wax esters, long-chain diacids, fatty acid ethyl esters, carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids. Metabolic pathway analysis and previous research results show that hydrophobic substrates are potentially more preferred by <i>Y. lipolytica</i> than hydrophilic substrates to make high-value products at higher productivity, titer, rate, and yield. Hence, <i>Y. lipolytica</i> is becoming an efficient and promising biomanufacturing platform due to its capabilities in biosynthesis of extracellular lipases and directly converting the extracellular triacylglycerol oils and fats into high-value products. It is believed that the cell size and morphology of the <i>Y. lipolytica</i> is related to the cell growth, nutrient uptake, and product formation. Dimorphic <i>Y. lipolytica</i> demonstrates the yeast-to-hypha transition in response to the extracellular environments and genetic background. Yeast-to-hyphal transition regulating genes, such as <i>YlBEM1, YlMHY1</i> and <i>YlZNC1</i> and so forth, have been identified to involve as major transcriptional factors that control morphology transition in <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. The connection of the cell polarization including cell cycle and the dimorphic transition with the cell size and morphology in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> adapting to new growth are reviewed and discussed. This review also summarizes the general and advanced genetic tools that are used to build a <i>Y. lipolytica</i> biomanufacturing platform.

Title: Constructing Yeast Chimeric Pathways To Boost Lipophilic Terpene Synthesis.
Abstract: Synthetic chimeric biological system offers opportunities to illuminate principles of designing life, and a primary step is constructing synthetic chimeric pathways. Here, we constructed yeast chimeric pathways by transferring the genes from  Saccharomyces cerevisiae pathways into another budding yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for in vivo assembly. We efficiently diversified gene option, combination, localization order, and copy number as expected. Convergence of two yeast pathways, especially mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways, remarkably enhanced synthesis of a lipophilic terpene, lycopene. In the selected champion strain with 50-fold of enhanced lycopene production, the chimeric MVA pathway gathered three S. cerevisiae genes with particular copies and locations. Amazingly, therein we discovered distinct transcriptional up-regulation of three significant pathways correlated with acetyl-CoA supply and tuning of cellular lipid amounts and composition. Modulating these pathways further improved lycopene production to 150-fold, a final 259 mg/L (approximately 80 mg/g DCW). We primarily showed the capacity of boosting the synthesis of lipophilic products with yeast chimeric pathways.

Title: An endophytic isolate of the fungus Yarrowia lipolytica produces metabolites that ameliorate the negative impact of salt stress on the physiology of maize.
Abstract: To combat salinity, plants need easily accessible, safe and sustainable mechanisms for optimum growth. Recently, endophytes proved to be the promising candidates that helped the host plant to thrive under stress conditions. Therefore, the aim was to discover endophytic strain(s) and their mechanism of action to alleviate salt stress in maize. Keeping the diverse role of endophytes in view, 9 endophytic fungi from the spines of Euphorbia milli L. were isolated. Among the isolated fungal isolates, isolate FH1 was selected for further study on the basis of high antioxidant activity and capability to produce high indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-acetamide (IAM), phenol and flavonoid contents. The 18S rDNA sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis of the fungal isolate FH1 revealed to be Yarrowia lipolytica. Furthermore, the inoculation of Y. lipolytica FH1 had significantly promoted plant growth attributes in treated maize as compared to positive (salt stress) and negative (salt stress free) controls. Likewise, differences in chlorophyll, carotenes, electrolyte leakage, leaf relative water, peroxidase, catalase, ABA, IAA and proline contents were observed between treated maize and controls. Interestingly, Y. lipolytica FH1 inoculated plants showed lower endogenous ABA and higher endogenous IAA contents. From the results, we have concluded that Y. lipolytica inoculation has promoted the growth of maize plants through controlled metabolism and hormonal secretions (ABA and IAA) under salinity stress. Because of the fact, Y. lipolytica can be tried as an eco-friendly bio-fertilizer to achieve optimum crop productivity under saline conditions.

Title: Multicopy integrants of crt genes and co-expression of AMP deaminase improve lycopene production in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Lycopene has been broadly studied in recent decades due to its health benefits including cancer prevention, anti-atherogenic and anti-obesity effects, and modulation of the immune system. To obtain efficient synthesis of lycopene, extensive researches have been conducted in various microbial cells, including Yarrowia lipolytica, to heterologously produce lycopene using various genetic and metabolic engineering methods. In this study, the effects of copy numbers of lycopene synthesis genes, a variety of key central metabolic genes (especially AMP deaminase-encoding gene AMPD), and 5-L fermenter cultivation on lycopene production in Y. lipolytica were investigated and the engineered strains with significantly enhanced lycopene content (46-60 mg/g DCW) were achieved. It is therefore possible to make use of the obtained strains to meet the industrial demand of lycopene production on the basis of further genetic and process optimization.

Title: Homology-independent genome integration enables rapid library construction for enzyme expression and pathway optimization in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is an important oleaginous industrial microorganism used to produce biofuels and other value-added compounds. Although several genetic engineering tools have been developed for Y. lipolytica, there is no efficient method for genomic integration of large DNA fragments. In addition, methods for constructing multigene expression libraries for biosynthetic pathway optimization are still lacking in Y. lipolytica. In this study, we demonstrate that multiple and large DNA fragments can be randomly and efficiently integrated into the genome of Y. lipolytica in a homology-independent manner. This homology-independent integration generates variation in the chromosomal locations of the inserted fragments and in gene copy numbers, resulting in the expression differences in the integrated genes or pathways. Because of these variations, gene expression libraries can be easily created through one-step integration. As a proof of concept, a LIP2 (producing lipase) expression library and a library of multiple genes in the β-carotene biosynthetic pathway were constructed, and high-production strains were obtained through library screening. Our work demonstrates the potential of homology-independent genome integration for library construction, especially for multivariate modular libraries for metabolic pathways in Y. lipolytica, and will facilitate pathway optimization in metabolic engineering applications.

Title: Engineering the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce the aroma compound β-ionone.
Abstract: β-Ionone is a fragrant terpenoid that generates a pleasant floral scent and is used in diverse applications as a cosmetic and flavoring ingredient. A growing consumer desire for natural products has increased the market demand for natural β-ionone. To date, chemical extraction from plants remains the main approach for commercial natural β-ionone production. Unfortunately, changing climate and geopolitical issues can cause instability in the β-ionone supply chain. Microbial fermentation using generally recognized as safe (GRAS) yeast offers an alternative method for producing natural β-ionone. Yarrowia lipolytica is an attractive host due to its oleaginous nature, established genetic tools, and large intercellular pool size of acetyl-CoA (the terpenoid backbone precursor). A push-pull strategy via genome engineering was applied to a Y. lipolytica PO1f derived strain. Heterologous and native genes in the mevalonate pathway were overexpressed to push production to the terpenoid backbone geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, while the carB and biofunction carRP genes from Mucor circinelloides were introduced to pull flux towards β-carotene (i.e., ionone precursor). Medium tests combined with machine learning based data analysis and <sup>13</sup>C metabolite labeling investigated influential nutrients for the β-carotene strain that achieved > 2.5 g/L β-carotene in a rich medium. Further introduction of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) from Osmanthus fragrans resulted in the β-ionone production. Utilization of in situ dodecane trapping avoided ionone loss from vaporization (with recovery efficiencies of ~ 76%) during fermentation operations, which resulted in titers of 68 mg/L β-ionone in shaking flasks and 380 mg/L in a 2 L fermenter. Both β-carotene medium tests and β-ionone fermentation outcomes indicated the last enzymatic step CCD1 (rather than acetyl-CoA supply) as the key bottleneck. We engineered a GRAS Y. lipolytica platform for sustainable and economical production of the natural aroma β-ionone. Although β-carotene could be produced at high titers by Y. lipolytica, the synthesis of β-ionone was relatively poor, possibly due to low CCD1 activity and non-specific CCD1 cleavage of β-carotene. In addition, both β-carotene and β-ionone strains showed decreased performances after successive sub-cultures. For industrial application, β-ionone fermentation efforts should focus on both CCD enzyme engineering and strain stability improvement.

Title: Engineering global transcription to tune lipophilic properties in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Evolution of complex phenotypes in cells requires simultaneously tuning expression of large amounts of genes, which can be achieved by reprograming global transcription. Lipophilicity is an important complex trait in oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>. It is necessary to explore the changes of which genes' expression levels will tune cellular lipophilic properties via the strategy of global transcription engineering. We achieved a strategy of global transcription engineering in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> by modifying the sequences of a key transcriptional factor (TF), <i>SPT15</i>-<i>like</i> (<i>Yl</i>-<i>SPT15</i>). The combinatorial mutagenesis of this gene was achieved by DNA assembly of up to five expression cassettes of its error-prone PCR libraries. A heterologous beta-carotene biosynthetic pathway was constructed to research the effects of combined <i>Yl</i>-<i>SPT15</i> mutants on carotene and lipid production. As a result, we obtained both an "enhanced" strain with 4.7-fold carotene production and a "weakened" strain with 0.13-fold carotene production relative to the initial strain, nearly 40-fold changing range. Genotype verification, comparative transcriptome analysis, and detection of the amounts of total and free fatty acids were made for the selected strains, indicating effective tuning of cells' lipophilic properties. We exploited the key pathways including RNA polymerase, ketone body metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and degradation that drastically determined cells' variable lipophilicity. We have examined the effects of combinatorial mutagenesis of <i>Yl</i>-<i>SPT15</i> on cells' capacity of producing beta-carotene and lipids. The lipophilic properties in <i>Y. lipolytica</i> could be effectively tuned by simultaneously regulating genome-wide multi-gene expression levels. The exploited gene targets and pathways could guide design and reconstruction of yeast cells for tunable and optimal production of other lipophilic products.

Title: Improving the efficiency of homologous recombination by chemical and biological approaches in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Gene targeting is a challenge in Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) where non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is predominant over homologous recombination (HR). To improve the frequency and efficiency of HR in Y. lipolytica, the ku70 gene responsible for a double stand break (DSB) repair in the NHEJ pathway was disrupted, and the cell cycle was synchronized to the S-phase with hydroxyurea, respectively. Consequently, the HR frequency was over 46% with very short homology regions (50 bp): the pex10 gene was accurately deleted at a frequency of 60% and the β-carotene biosynthetic genes were integrated at the correct locus at an average frequency of 53%. For repeated use, the URA3 marker gene was also excised and deleted at a frequency of 100% by HR between the 100 bp homology regions flanking the URA3 gene. It was shown that appropriate combination of these chemical and biological approaches was very effective to promote HR and construct genetically modified Y. lipolytica strains for biotechnological applications.

Title: Engineering of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for production of astaxanthin.
Abstract: Astaxanthin is a red-colored carotenoid, used as food and feed additive. Astaxanthin is mainly produced by chemical synthesis, however, the process is expensive and synthetic astaxanthin is not approved for human consumption. In this study, we engineered the oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> for <i>de novo</i> production of astaxanthin by fermentation. First, we screened 12 different <i>Y. lipolytica</i> isolates for β-carotene production by introducing two genes for β-carotene biosynthesis: bi-functional phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase (<i>crtYB</i>) and phytoene desaturase (<i>crtI</i>) from the red yeast <i>Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous</i>. The best strain produced 31.1 ± 0.5 mg/L β-carotene. Next, we optimized the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (<i>HMG1</i>) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (<i>GGS1/crtE</i>) in the best producing strain and obtained 453.9 ± 20.2 mg/L β-carotene. Additional downregulation of the competing squalene synthase <i>SQS1</i> increased the β-carotene titer to 797.1 ± 57.2 mg/L. Then we introduced β-carotene ketolase (<i>crtW</i>) from <i>Paracoccus</i> sp. N81106 and hydroxylase (<i>crtZ</i>) from <i>Pantoea ananatis</i> to convert β-carotene into astaxanthin. The constructed strain accumulated 10.4 ± 0.5 mg/L of astaxanthin but also accumulated astaxanthin biosynthesis intermediates, 5.7 ± 0.5 mg/L canthaxanthin, and 35.3 ± 1.8 mg/L echinenone. Finally, we optimized the copy numbers of <i>crtZ</i> and <i>crtW</i> to obtain 3.5 mg/g DCW (54.6 mg/L) of astaxanthin in a microtiter plate cultivation. Our study for the first time reports engineering of <i>Y. lipolytica</i> for the production of astaxanthin. The high astaxanthin content and titer obtained even in a small-scale cultivation demonstrates a strong potential for <i>Y. lipolytica</i>-based fermentation process for astaxanthin production.

Title: Host and Pathway Engineering for Enhanced Lycopene Biosynthesis in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: Carotenoids are a class of molecules with commercial value as food and feed additives with nutraceutical properties. Shifting carotenoid synthesis from petrochemical-based precursors to bioproduction from sugars and other biorenewable carbon sources promises to improve process sustainability and economics. In this work, we engineered the oleaginous yeast <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> to produce the carotenoid lycopene. To enhance lycopene production, we tested a series of strategies to modify host cell physiology and metabolism, the most successful of which were mevalonate pathway overexpression and alleviating auxotrophies previously engineered into the PO1f strain of <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. The beneficial engineering strategies were combined into a single strain, which was then cultured in a 1-L bioreactor to produce 21.1 mg/g DCW. The optimized strain overexpressed a total of eight genes including two copies of HMG1, two copies of CrtI, and single copies of MVD1, EGR8, CrtB, and CrtE. Recovering leucine and uracil biosynthetic capacity also produced significant enhancement in lycopene titer. The successful engineering strategies characterized in this work represent a significant increase in understanding carotenoid biosynthesis in <i>Y. lipolytica</i>, not only increasing lycopene titer but also informing future studies on carotenoid biosynthesis.

Title: A synthetic biology approach to transform Yarrowia lipolytica into a competitive biotechnological producer of β-carotene.
Abstract: The increasing market demands of β-carotene as colorant, antioxidant and vitamin precursor, requires novel biotechnological production platforms. Yarrowia lipolytica, is an industrial organism unable to naturally synthesize carotenoids but with the ability to produce high amounts of the precursor Acetyl-CoA. We first found that a lipid overproducer strain was capable of producing more β-carotene than a wild type after expressing the heterologous pathway. Thereafter, we developed a combinatorial synthetic biology approach base on Golden Gate DNA assembly to screen the optimum promoter-gene pairs for each transcriptional unit expressed. The best strain reached a production titer of 1.5 g/L and a maximum yield of 0.048 g/g of glucose in flask. β-carotene production was further increased in controlled conditions using a fed-batch fermentation. A total production of β-carotene of 6.5 g/L and 90 mg/g DCW with a concomitant production of 42.6 g/L of lipids was achieved. Such high titers suggest that engineered Y. lipolytica is a competitive producer organism of β-carotene.

Title: Synthetic biology for manufacturing chemicals: constraints drive the use of non-conventional microbial platforms.
Abstract: Genetically modified microbes have had much industrial success producing protein-based products (such as antibodies and enzymes). However, engineering microbial workhorses for biomanufacturing of commodity compounds remains challenging. First, microbes cannot afford burdens with both overexpression of multiple enzymes and metabolite drainage for product synthesis. Second, synthetic circuits and introduced heterologous pathways are not yet as "robust and reliable" as native pathways due to hosts' innate regulations, especially under suboptimal fermentation conditions. Third, engineered enzymes may lack channeling capabilities for cascade-like transport of metabolites to overcome diffusion barriers or to avoid intermediate toxicity in the cytoplasmic environment. Fourth, moving engineered hosts from laboratory to industry is unreliable because genetic mutations and non-genetic cell-to-cell variations impair the large-scale fermentation outcomes. Therefore, synthetic biology strains often have unsatisfactory industrial performance (titer/yield/productivity). To overcome these problems, many different species are being explored for their metabolic strengths that can be leveraged to synthesize specific compounds. Here, we provide examples of non-conventional and genetically amenable species for industrial manufacturing, including the following: Corynebacterium glutamicum for its TCA cycle-derived biosynthesis, Yarrowia lipolytica for its biosynthesis of fatty acids and carotenoids, cyanobacteria for photosynthetic production from its sugar phosphate pathways, and Rhodococcus for its ability to biotransform recalcitrant feedstock. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies (e.g., genome-to-phenome mapping, single cell methods, and knowledge engineering) that may facilitate the development of novel cell factories.

Title: Simultaneous determination of intracellular nucleotides and coenzymes in Yarrowia lipolytica producing lipid and lycopene by capillary zone electrophoresis.
Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast with promise in producing terpenoids such as lycopene. Though methods for analyzing primary metabolic intermediates have been established, further work is needed to better analyze nucleotides and coenzymes. Here, we presented an optimized method for the separation of nucleotides and coenzymes in Y. lipolytica using the capillary electrophoresis. The separation of twelve metabolites including four coenzymes, five nucleotides and three nucleosides was achieved within 32min using a voltage of 15kV and 70mM sodium carbonate/hydrogencarbonate buffer with 1.0% β-CD at pH 10. The results show that the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate changed significantly between lycopene producing strain and the control, indicating that these two metabolites may be closely related with lycopene production. The optimized method provides a useful approach for future metabolic analysis of fermentation process as well as industrial strain improvement.

Title: Metabolomic changes and metabolic responses to expression of heterologous biosynthetic genes for lycopene production in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The metabolomic studies were conducted for both the engineered lycopene-producing Yarrowia lipolytica strain and the control strain. The changes in metabolome profiling and main pathway abundance of Y. lipolytica with the introduction of heterologous crt genes were investigated by multiple analytical and statistical methods More importantly, the metabolome data were transformed into pathway abundances visualized by a pathway relationship network using Cytoscape software. This network provided a simple way to present the statistical results of pathway abundance and interpret the effects of the crt genes in a metabolic view, and the results highlighted the up-regulation of eight pathways and the down-regulation of three pathways in the lycopene fast production phase. The comprehensive analysis suggested that the synthesis of lycopene has remarkable effects on fructose and mannose metabolism, citrate cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis and metabolism of some amino acids including valine, leucine and isoleucine in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Iterative integration of multiple-copy pathway genes in Yarrowia lipolytica for heterologous β-carotene production.
Abstract: β-Carotene is a terpenoid molecule with high hydrophobicity that is often used as an additive in foods and feed. Previous work has demonstrated the heterologous biosynthesis of β-carotene from an intrinsic high flux of acetyl-CoA in 12 steps through 11 genes in Yarrowia lipolytica. Here, an efficient biosynthetic pathway capable of producing 100-fold more β-carotene than the baseline construct was generated using strong promoters and multiple gene copies for each of the 12 steps. Using fed-batch fermentation with an optimized medium, the engineered pathway could produce 4g/L β-carotene, which was stored in lipid droplets within engineered Y. lipolytica cells. Expansion of these cells for squalene production also demonstrated that Y. lipolytica could be an industrially relevant platform for hydrophobic terpenoid production.

Title: Production of β-carotene by expressing a heterologous multifunctional carotene synthase in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: To obtain functional expression of a heterologous multifunctional carotene synthase containing phytoene synthase, phytoene dehydrogenase, and lycopene β-cyclase activities encoded by carS from Schizochytrium sp. in order to allow Yarrowia lipolytica to produce β-carotene. To increase the integration efficiency of a 3.8 kb carS under the control of P <sub>GPD</sub> promoter with a 2 kb selection marker, ura3, along with a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGS1) expression cassette (~10 kb in total), was inserted into the Y. lipolytica chromosome, and the DNA assembler method was combined with double chromosomal deletions of ku70 and ku80. This method resulted in a 13.4-fold increase in integration efficiency compared with the original method, reaching 63% (10/16). The resulting recombinant Y. lipolytica produced 0.41 mg β-carotene per g dry cell weight, while the wild type did not produce any indicating the functionality of the multifunctional carotene synthase in Y. lipolytica. Expression of GGS1 and a multifunctional carotene synthase from Schizochytrium sp. in Y. lipolytica led to β-carotene production. DNA assembler efficiency was greatly increased by the deletion of ku70 and ku80, which resulted in decreased in vivo nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in Y. lipolytica.

Title: Golden Gate Assembly system dedicated to complex pathway manipulation in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: In this study, we have adopted Golden Gate modular cloning strategy to develop a robust and versatile DNA assembly platform for the nonconventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. To this end, a broad set of destination vectors and interchangeable building blocks have been constructed. The DNA modules were assembled on a scaffold of predesigned 4 nt overhangs covering three transcription units (each bearing promoter, gene and terminator), selection marker gene and genomic integration targeting sequences, constituting altogether thirteen elements. Previously validated DNA modules (regulatory elements and selection markers) were adopted as the Golden Gate bricks. The system's operability was demonstrated based on synthetic pathway of carotenoid production. This technology greatly enriches a molecular biology toolbox dedicated to this industrially relevant microorganism enabling fast combinatorial cloning of complex synthetic pathways.

Title: Hydrolysis of carotenoid esters from <i>Tagetes erecta</i> by the action of lipases from <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>.
Abstract: The present study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of carotenoid esters from <i>Tagetes erecta</i> using lipases from the yeast of <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, with the aim of obtaining free lutein. The optimal concentrations of seven nutrients, considering the production of lipases relative to biomass (<i>Y</i><sub>p/x</sub>) as the response variable, were determined in flask fermentations. In addition, we studied the effect on hydrolysis of growing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> in the presence of the oleoresin of the marigold flower in flask and stirred tank. Furthermore, hydrolysis of the oleoresin using the lipases from this microorganism was compared with the hydrolysis using lipases from <i>Rhizopus oryzae</i>. Cultured in the presence of marigold oleoresin, <i>Y. lipolytica</i> showed an increase in free carotenoids of 12.41% in flask and 8.8% in stirred tank, representing a fourfold and a threefold increase compared to the initial value in the fermentation, respectively. When lipases from the supernatant from both microorganisms were used for only 14 h hydrolysis experiments, a slight increase was achieved compared to a blank. We concluded that carotenoid esters of the oleoresin could not be completely hydrolyzed in 14 h by these lipases, but that growing <i>Y. lipolytica</i> in the presence of marigold oleoresin gives until fourfold production of free carotenoids in 72 h fermentations.

Title: Standardized Markerless Gene Integration for Pathway Engineering in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising microbial host due to its native capacity to produce lipid-based chemicals. Engineering stable production strains requires genomic integration of modified genes, avoiding episomal expression that requires specialized media to maintain selective pressures. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for targeted, markerless gene integration into the Y. lipolytica genome. A set of genomic loci was screened to identify sites that were accepting of gene integrations without impacting cell growth. Five sites were found to meet these criteria. Expression levels from a GFP expression cassette were consistent when inserted into AXP, XPR2, A08, and D17, with reduced expression from MFE1. The standardized tool is comprised of five pairs of plasmids (one homologous donor plasmid and a CRISPR-Cas9 expression plasmid), with each pair targeting gene integration into one of the characterized sites. To demonstrate the utility of the tool we rapidly engineered a semisynthetic lycopene biosynthesis pathway by integrating four different genes at different loci. The capability to integrate multiple genes without the need for marker recovery and into sites with known expression levels will enable more rapid and reliable pathway engineering in Y. lipolytica.

Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is a safe and robust yeast that has a history of industrial applications. Its physiological, metabolic and genomic characteristics have made it a superior host for metabolic engineering. The results of optimizing internal pathways and introducing new pathways have demonstrated that Y. lipolytica can be a platform cell factory for cost-effective production of chemicals and fuels derived from fatty acids, lipids and acetyl-CoA. Two products have been commercialized from metabolically engineered Y. lipolytica strains producing high amounts of omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid, and more products are on the way to be produced at industrial scale. Here we review recent progress in metabolic engineering of Y. lipolytica for production of biodiesel fuel, functional fatty acids and carotenoids.

Title: One-step integration of multiple genes into the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is an unconventional yeast, and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). It provides a versatile fermentation platform that is used commercially to produce many added-value products. Here we report a multiple fragment assembly method that allows one-step integration of an entire β-carotene biosynthesis pathway (~11 kb, consisting of four genes) via in vivo homologous recombination into the rDNA locus of the Y. lipolytica chromosome. The highest efficiency was 21%, and the highest production of β-carotene was 2.2 ± 0.3 mg per g dry cell weight. The total procedure was completed in less than one week, as compared to a previously reported sequential gene integration method that required n weeks for n genes. This time-saving method will facilitate synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and functional genomics studies of Y. lipolytica.

Title: Production of lycopene in the non-carotenoid-producing yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: The codon-optimized genes crtB and crtI of Pantoea ananatis were expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica under the control of the TEF1 promoter of Y. lipolytica. Additionally, the rate-limiting genes for isoprenoid biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica, GGS1 and HMG1, were overexpressed to increase the production of lycopene. All of the genes were also expressed in a Y. lipolytica strain with POX1 to POX6 and GUT2 deleted, which led to an increase in the size of lipid bodies and a further increase in lycopene production. Lycopene is located mainly within lipid bodies, and increased lipid body formation leads to an increase in the lycopene storage capacity of Y. lipolytica. Growth-limiting conditions increase the specific lycopene content. Finally, a yield of 16 mg g(-1) (dry cell weight) was reached in fed-batch cultures, which is the highest value reported so far for a eukaryotic host.

Title: The safety of β-carotene from Yarrowia lipolytica.
Abstract: Crystalline β-carotene from genetically modified Yarrowia lipolytica is an alternative source of β-carotene for use as a nutritional supplement. To support the use of β-carotene from Y. lipolytica as a food ingredient, the genotoxic and subchronic toxicity potential of this compound was determined. Genotoxicity was examined using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli (Ames test), a chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary WBL cells, and the micronucleus test in CD-1 mice. All three assays showed no significant results due to β-carotene from Y. lipolytica. In a subchronic toxicity study in SD rats, β-carotene from Y. lipolytica was administered by oral gavage for 13weeks at 0, 125, 250 or 500mg/kg per day. Adverse effects were not observed following clinical, clinical pathology and gross- and histopathological evaluations of dosed rats; thus, the no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) for β-carotene from Y. lipolytica was 500mg/kg, the highest dose used in the study. In conclusion, β-carotene derived from Y. lipolytica was shown in genotoxicity models and a standard rat subchronic rat study to have a safety profile similar to that of the current commercial products (synthetic and natural) with no unexpected finding attributable to the alternative source.

Abstract: Oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is capable of accumulating large amount of lipids. There is a growing interest to engineer this organism to produce lipid-derived compounds for a variety of applications. In addition, biosynthesis of value-added products such as carotenoid and its derivatives have been explored. In this chapter, we describe methods to integrate genes involved in lycopene biosynthesis in Yarrowia. Each bacterial gene involved in lycopene biosynthesis, crtE, crtB, and crtI, will be assembled with yeast promoters and terminators and subsequently transformed into Yarrowia through random integration. The engineered strain can produce lycopene under lipid accumulation conditions.

Title: The 'LipoYeasts' project: using the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica in combination with specific bacterial genes for the bioconversion of lipids, fats and oils into high-value products.
Abstract: The oleochemical industry is currently still dominated by conventional chemistry, with biotechnology only starting to play a more prominent role, primarily with respect to the biosurfactants or lipases, e.g. as detergents, or for biofuel production. A major bottleneck for all further biotechnological applications is the problem of the initial mobilization of cheap and vastly available lipid and oil substrates, which are then to be transformed into high-value biotechnological, nutritional or pharmacological products. Under the EU-sponsored LipoYeasts project we are developing the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica into a versatile and high-throughput microbial factory that, by use of specific enzymatic pathways from hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, efficiently mobilizes lipids by directing its versatile lipid metabolism towards the production of industrially valuable lipid-derived compounds like wax esters (WE), isoprenoid-derived compounds (carotenoids, polyenic carotenoid ester), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and free hydroxylated fatty acids (HFAs). Different lipid stocks (petroleum, alkane, vegetable oil, fatty acid) and combinations thereof are being assessed as substrates in combination with different mutant and recombinant strains of Y. lipolytica, in order to modulate the composition and yields of the produced added-value products.
