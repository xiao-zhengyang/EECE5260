-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [microorganism, metabolic pathway, gene, bioproduct, bioreactor, fermentation process, metabolic engineering, biosynthetic pathway, yeast strain, carotenoid, antioxidant, detergent, genome engineering, high-throughput screening, mutagenesis, biotechnology, synthetic biology, metabolite, enzyme, transcription factor, cell factory, bioproduct platform, CRISPR-Cas9, oleaginous yeast, lipid metabolism, signal transduction, chromosome, gene knockout, in vitro process, multiobjective optimization, terpenoid, plant hormone, transcription engineering, error-prone PCR, mevalonate pathway, bioreactor cultivation]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided texts is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided texts is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

 biotechnology develop a sustainable economy using green technology based on microorganisms and synthetic biology through two case studies that improve metabolic capacity in yeast models Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). We aim to increase the production capacity of beta-carotene (β-carotene) and succinic acid, which are among the highest market demands due to their versatile use in numerous consumer products. We performed simulations to identify in silico ranking of strains based on multiple objectives: the growth rate of yeast microorganisms, the number of used chromosomes, and the production capability of β-carotene (for Y. lipolytica) and succinate (for S. cerevisiae). Our multiobjective optimization methodology identified notable gene deletions by searching a vast solution space to highlight near-optimal strains on Pareto Fronts, balancing the above-cited three objectives. Moreover, preserving the metabolic constraints and the essential genes,

text:
 a considerable portion of astaxanthin was found excreted into the spent oil. Astaxanthin was the predominant carotenoid in the extracellular oil phase that allowed facile in situ recovery of astaxanthin without cell lysis. Autoclaving the safflower oil medium elevated the peroxide level but it declined quickly during fermentation (reduced by 84% by day 3) and did not inhibit cell growth or astaxanthin production. In a 1.5-L fed-batch bioreactor culture with a YnB-based medium containing 20% safflower oil, and with the feeding of casamino acids, astaxanthin production reached 54 mg/L (53% excreted) in 28 days. Further improvement in astaxanthin titer and productivity was achieved by restoring leucine biosynthesis in the host, and running fed-batch fermentation using a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio yeast extract
