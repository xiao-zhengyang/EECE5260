       "Looking at the terms, many are related to β-Carotene, like β-Carotene synthesis pathway, genes involved in its production, fermentation processes, and specific enzymes like crtE, crtYB, crtZ. Then there's mention of Yarrowia lipolytica, which is a yeast used for producing carotenoids. There are also terms about metabolic pathways like the Pentose phosphate pathway, mevalonate pathway, and maybe the phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase (PK-PTA) pathway. \n",
       "\n",

       "Other terms mention safety and toxicity evaluations, like Genotoxicity, Ames test, Micronucleus test, and Safety profile. There's also some mention of bioprocess metrics, such as Yield, β-Carotene content, titer, and mg/g DCW. \n",
       "\n",
       "I need to categorize these into sections. Let me start by grouping similar terms. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Genetic Engineering & Synthetic Biology**: Terms like CRISPR-iCas9, multigene cassette, codon-optimized genes, etc.\n",
       "2. **Metabolic Pathways**: Pentose phosphate pathway, mevalonate pathway, carotenogenesis genes, etc.\n",
       "3. **Enzymes & Key Genes**: crtE, crtYB, crtZ, CarB, CrtW, HMG-CoA reductase, etc.\n",
       "4. **Fermentation & Bioprocess Optimization**: Fed-batch, DO-stat, optimized medium, nutrient conditions, etc.\n",
       "5. **Yeast Strain Engineering**: Yarrowia lipolytica, engineered strains, lipid overproducer, etc.\n",
       "6. **Carotenoid Types & Synthesis**: β-Carotene, Astaxanthin, Zeaxanthin, etc.\n",
       "7. **Safety & Toxicity Studies**: Genotoxicity, Ames test, micronucleus test, safety profile.\n",
       "8. **Performance & Yield Metrics**: Yield, titer, content, mg/g DCW, etc.\n",
       "9. **Experimental Methods**: 13C labeling, flux adjustment, quantitative analysis, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, some terms like \"β-Carotene ketolase\" might fall under enzymes, and \"Lipid droplets\" could be under sub-organelles or lipid metabolism. Also, terms like \"Clinical evaluations\" and \"CD-1 mice\" relate to safety and toxicity. \n",
       "\n",
       "I should make sure not to miss any terms and check if some belong to multiple categories. For example, \"Pentose phosphate pathway\" is under metabolic pathways but is also mentioned with genes, so maybe include it in both if needed. However, the user wants them categorized, so perhaps group by main theme. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now, structuring the summary report would involve an overview, then each section detailing the categories, and a conclusion. I need to ensure that all terms are covered and the summary is comprehensive but concise. Also, the user might be looking for insights into how these elements interrelate in carotenoid production, so highlighting key areas like genetic engineering, pathway optimization, and bioprocess conditions would be important. \n",
       "\n",
       "I should also check for any repeated terms, like \"β-Carot\" and \"β-Carotene\" which might be typos or variations. Need to treat them as the same term. Terms like \"Genetic engineering methods\" and \"Genetic engineering\" can be grouped together. \n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the summary should highlight the main strategies used in β-carotene production using Y. lipolytica, the key gene clusters, and the methods for optimizing yield and safety. Make sure to mention the integration of different techniques like metabolic pathway engineering, genetic modifications, and bioprocess optimization.\n",
